{"sentence": "The Robot Dog Designed To Explore Mars Boston Dynamics Spot Robot Dog Designed To Explore Mars. Humans have been curious about the world outside of Earth for the longest time. Nations have become rivals to earn the coveted title of being the first to get to some space body, the Moon for example. For a while, it looked like we became satisfied with our planet but now, there is a new space race brewing and the destination is Mars. Mars may be regarded as the closest planet to Earth in our solar system but it is still nothing like Earth. Its atmosphere is toxic to humans and so exploring it has so far been limited to rovers and helicopters. Many innovations have gone into making space exploration easier for humans, some more effective than others. It almost seems like we have seen it all but what if more interesting ways have risen to bring animals into the mix?

{"sentence": "With a heavy heart before a tearful breakup with actress Rachel McAdams, goodbye Rachel McAdams With a heavy heart before a tearful breakup with actress Rachel McAdams, goodbye Rachel McAdams #rachelmcadams Rachel Anne McAdams[1] (born November 17, 1978)[2][1] is a Canadian actress. After graduating from a theatre degree program at York University in 2001, she worked in Canadian television and film productions, such as the drama film Perfect Pie (2002), for which she received a Genie Award nomination, the comedy film My Name Is Tanino (2002), and the comedy series Slings and Arrows (2003\u20132005), for which she won a Gemini Award. In 2002, she made her Hollywood film debut in the comedy The Hot Chick. She rose to fame in 2004 with the comedy Mean Girls and the romantic drama The Notebook. In 2005, she starred in the romantic comedy Wedding Crashers, the psychological thriller Red Eye, and the comedy-drama The Family Stone. She was hailed by the media as Hollywood's new \"it girl\",[3][4] and received a BAFTA Award nomination for Best Rising Star. After a brief sabbatical, she returned to prominence in 2009 by appearing in the political thriller State of Play, the romance The Time Traveler's Wife, and the 2009 mystery film Sherlock Holmes. In 2010, she appeared in the star vehicle comedy film Morning Glory, and starred in Midnight in Paris (2011), The Vow (2012) and About Time (2013). In 2015, she starred in the second season of the HBO anthology crime drama series True Detective, and portrayed journalist Sacha Pfeiffer in the drama Spotlight. For the latter, she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. This was followed by roles in the superhero film Doctor Strange (2016), its 2022 sequel, the romantic drama Disobedience (2017), and the comedies Game Night (2018) and Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga (2020). In 2001, McAdams made her television debut in the MTV pilot Shotgun Love Dolls as Beth Swanson, which was filmed during spring break from York University.[25] She also made her Canadian film debut that year in the comedy My Name is Tanino. The Italian-Canadian co-production was filmed in Sicily when McAdams was 22 years old, and it marked her first time on an airplane.[32][33] McAdams later earned a Genie Award nomination in Canada for her role in the drama Perfect Pie.[17] In 2002, she made her Hollywood film debut with Rob Schneider and Anna Faris in the comedy The Hot Chick, which McAdams has described as a \"huge milestone\" in her career.[21] She played a catty high school student who swaps bodies with Schneider's character, a small-time criminal.[17] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times felt she \"emerges as a young actress of much promise\".[34] Afterwards, McAdams returned to Canada to star as Kate McNab in Slings and Arrows, a comedy mini-series about backstage theatre life at the fictional New Burbage Shakespearean Festival.[35] She was written out of the second season of the program following her success in the United States.[30] She received two Gemini Award nominations for her work on the program, winning one. McAdams's break-out role came in 2004, when she starred in the comedy film Mean Girls opposite Lindsay Lohan, Lacey Chabert, and Amanda Seyfried, based on Rosalind Wiseman's book Queen Bees and Wannabes. McAdams was 24 years old when she was cast as the mean high school queen bee Regina George, and she modelled her character on Alec Baldwin's performance in the drama Glengarry Glen Ross (1992).[37][38] Mike Clark of USA Today praised her \"comic flair\"[39] while Jenny McCartney of The Daily Telegraph found her \"delightfully hateful.\"[40] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that \"McAdams brings glamour and magnetism to Regina, but also the right hint of comic distance.\"[41] The film grossed $129 million worldwide[42] and earned McAdams two MTV Movie Awards.[43] Mean Girls later reached No. 12 in an Entertainment Weekly list of the Greatest Ever High School Movies.[44] Tina Fey, who co\u2011starred in the film and wrote the screenplay, has credited McAdams with teaching her how to act in front of a camera rather than an audience: \"She's a film actor. She's not pushing. And so I kind of learned that lesson from watching her.\"[45]", "label": "harmless"}

The Voyager 1 spacecraft is now traversing interstellar space. In 2012, it crossed through the heliopause. The heliopause is the boundary between the Sun's solar winds and the interstellar medium, which includes all matter and radiation in the region between solar systems in the galaxy.This means that Voyager 1 is smack dab in the middle of the Milky Way's cosmic emptiness.

Have faith that you will get where you are supposed to be if you focus your efforts into the areas that matter, but don't worry too much about the short-term results. Don't be a 'schemer.' Instead, like the Joker -- just DO THINGS. You might get farther than you thought. And as always my dear friends, greatness is coming.

That's because it's not just one star breaking down or exploding, it's actually two stars coming together and putting on a fantastic light show that sets it apart from anything else in the cosmos. The thing about a kilonova is that it's exceedingly rare so not much is known about it. It's hard enough to find one star that's reached the end of its life cycle - Let alone two that are merging together. However, NASA's Hubble Telescope recently caught sight of a kilonova and it was truly something special, incredibly unique, and awe-inspiring.

The second instalment in a two-part series, it serves as a sequel to the 2018 film K.G.F: Chapter 1. The film stars Yash, Sanjay Dutt, Raveena Tandon, Srinidhi Shetty and Prakash Raj. It follows the assassin Rocky, who after establishing himself as the kingpin of the Kolar Gold Fields, must retain his supremacy over adversaries and government officials, while also coming to terms with his past. Produced on a budget of \u20b9100 crore (US$13 million), K.G.F: Chapter 2 is the most expensive Kannada film ever made. Neel retained the technicians from its predecessor with Bhuvan Gowda handling the cinematography and Ravi Basrur scoring the music for the soundtrack and the film's background. Dutt and Tandon joined the cast in early 2019, marking the former's Kannada film debut. Portions of the film were shot back-to-back with Chapter 1. Principal photography for the rest of the sequences commenced in March 2019, but was halted in February 2020 owing to the COVID-19 lockdown in India. Filming resumed five months later and was completed in December 2020. Locations included Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mysore and Kolar. K.G.F: Chapter 2 was theatrically released in India on 14 April 2022 in Kannada, along with dubbed versions in Hindi, Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam languages. It is also the first Kannada film to release in IMAX. The film received mixed reviews from critics but was generally considered an improvement over its predecessor. Neel's direction, the action sequences, cinematography and performances (particularly Yash) received praise, but the pace and writing attracted criticism. Besides recording the second highest-opening day in India, the film set domestic opening day records in Kannada, Hindi and Malayalam, and surpassed the lifetime gross of its predecessor in two days to become the highest-grossing Kannada film. With earnings of \u20b91,204 crore (US$160 million) globally, K.G.F: Chapter 2 is the third highest-grossing Indian film of all time, and also the second highest-grossing film in India.

If there is one thing we should all know about black holes, it's that they are \"Mysterious,\" \"Dangerous,\" and \"Death yawning abysses\"? As much as scientists have tried to understand them fully, black holes continue to have a mystique and horror surrounding them. This raises the question, is there a black hole out in the universe that could threaten us as humans? If there is, what's on the opposite side of this gaping chasm of death?

{"sentence": "The Largest Volcano Ever Is Waking Up. Can We Survive It? The Largest Volcano Ever Is Waking Up. Can We Survive It? Death and destruction are common outcomes of volcanic eruptions. These eruptions produce extremely hot lava, engulfing communities and crops and wreaking havoc. Volcanic ash produced can cause respiratory difficulties as well as impediments to air transport. Large volcanoes have the potential to wipe out entire animal and human populations, as well as cause trillions of dollars in economic damage. Who knows what will happen to humanity if the world's supervolcanoes all decide to erupt at once. Would there be hope for our survival now that these beasts are starting to wake up from their slumber? The constant reawakening of Mauna Loa's volcano has garnered recent media attention, and the volcano\u2019s activity should not be ignored. Mauna Loa is the world's largest active volcano, rising gradually to a height of 4,170 meters (13,681 ft). Its broad undersea flanks drop 5 kilometers (3 miles) below sea level to the ocean floor.

Not only is it bigger, more powerful, more advanced, and more efficient, it\u2019s also capable of being used more than once. In fact, Elon Musk has said that his plan for Starship is to fire up each and every vessel thousands of times. If that is achieved, Starship will radically transform how we travel through space. It will really make flying among the stars much more like flying from airport to airport. Space travel will never be the same. The Starship creation is a massive feat of engineering that has caught the attention of everyone involved in the modern space race. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say it is the gold standard for current space travel vehicles. There is a reason why NASA has become involved with SpaceX and asked them to build a Starship capable of landing astronauts on the moon. And it\u2019s no surprise to think that the Starship vehicle will be the one that first touches down on Mars within the next couple decades. Starship just really is that special. In fact, in just a few years you might be able to fly upon one and bounce around the atmosphere and into outer space. Well, if you have a lot of disposable income on hand, that is. But did you know that Starship is more than just a craft to get astronauts to the moon, Mars, and beyond? Did you know that there is far more to it than simply ferrying people around and advancing space tourism? It\u2019s true, Starship is going to do a whole more than just that. It\u2019s also going to completely change the way items and goods are shipped. Not only will Starship help usher pivotal pieces of equipment and manufacturing and goods to space, it will also help get them from point A to point B right here on Earth. #Voyager #SpaceX Starship", "label": "harmless"}

Since the dawn of time, when humanity first made the decision to look up at night, we have been enthralled by the mystery of space. The movement of planets, the formation of stars, and the appearance of comets are just a few examples of what has baffled us for countless years, inspiring everything from art, literature, and science to religion, superstition, and spiritual inspiration. Rare cosmic events draw our attention to the heavens because of their unique, almost sacred aspects. Some of the incredible astronomical events that we might witness in our lifetimes include comets, eclipses, supernovas, meteor showers, and even the extremely special death of a star. You must see all of these celestial events, which can be seen using a pair of binoculars, a small telescope, or even with the unaided eye. Get your telescopes and calendars ready as we present to you the most insane space events happening in the future.

While they once only existed on the radio, television, and newspapers, now you seemingly can't take even a few steps without someone trying to sell you something. Over the last generation, the art of advertising has become even more nuanced and carefully crafted. Still, you know when you see an ad. That's because they really are everywhere. Well, almost everywhere. There is still one place where ads have barely ventured: the final frontier of space. For many reasons, major companies have yet to break out of our atmosphere and sell their goods among the stars. Why is that? More importantly, what would it look like if NASA, or another space agency such as SpaceX, made the radical choice to place adverts on their high-flying creations?

Q&A With Charles F. Gray | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DmFseuHX9M Today's Sunday Sermon is inspired by a question that I received directly from NYC Korean MGTOW, but has been circulating throughout the MGTOW community and forums for quite some time: Was Jesus a MGTOW? While I can in no way answer that question, I can look at five of Jesus' most MGTOW moments and dissect them from a MGTOW lens. Let me know what you think and if there are any more moments that you could point to! 1) His ministry and life He took nothing for himself, and after living what is estimated as his first 30 years of life as a carpenter, he spent three years as a nomad, not having a home but preaching in what Sandman would call, TMOW, or Traveling My Own Way. 2) Look at the Disciples Look at the disciples. Not even Mary Magdalene was a disciple. All 12 disciples were men. Were they special, genius men, not necessarily. It\u2019s generally accepted that seven of the 12 disciples were fishermen. It wouldn\u2019t have worked during that day either, because women were not teachers. The religious, political and educational leaders were all males. It\u2019s likely something that women wouldn\u2019t have been able to handle either, going from town to town with no provision. Jesus himself demanded this nomadic, MGTOW approach detailed in Matthew 10:5 \u201cDo not take along any gold or silver or copper in your belts; take no bag for the journey, or extra tunic, or sandals or staff; for the worker is worth his keep\u201d. 3) Jesus and his statement that it is better not to marry - eunuchs When asked by the disciples whether or not a man should marry, Jesus states that if a man can accept singleness then he should accept it. Paul reiterates this as well. If they're saying this in a patriarchal society, then this has even more credence in a gynocentric culture. 4) Jesus in the Temple Upon entering the Temple, Jesus flips over a series of tables that are being used for commerce instead of honoring the space the Temple is meant for. This is the perfect combination of the MGTOW meekness that I just talked about. Reserve that power and that energy. Discretion is a better part of valor as the Age of Empires II quote is. I don\u2019t like defining traits of a MGTOW man, but I believe that we should aim to be a meek group. Reserved power ready to burst when the time is right. 5) Jesus and the Women at the Well Many of you likely know this story. It involves Jesus' interaction with a woman that has had five husbands and is also living with another man that is not her wife. He confronts her and says, \u201cYou are right when you say you have no husband. 18 The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true.\u201d This statement says many things. It not only is something that a typical man wouldn\u2019t know about a women, but it\u2019s not something that a man, who likely would be hitting on a woman, would ever bring up. He would look right past it and say, well I\u2019m the one that is right here in the here and now, so who cares about those five-ex husbands. Jesus calls her out in plain sight. Red pill truth and honesty. Also, this is proof that women are still the hypergamous beings that they were 2000 years ago. Once again, there is nothing new under the sun. One man can\u2019t satisfy a woman whose mind and heart is in the wrong place. She obviously wasn\u2019t satisfied with her current husband either, because it would not be honorable for a woman to be engaging in public conversation with a man like this in the first place. Jesus essentially cornered her in so that he could share his message to her in that moment about His coming as the Messiah. So men, I hope that you enjoyed today\u2019s Sunday Sermon as much as I did in reporting on it. If you have anything to add or any other MGTOW moments from Jesus that you are aware of, please hit me up with them in the description. Also, don\u2019t forget to give me your suggestions for MGTOW men in history as well. I\u2019d love to get that series going. #hoodiesup", "label": "harmless"}

{"sentence": "Pride Month Speedpaint #1 - Hadiah Zenka - Transgender (FTM) {Please read Description} Well after 9 months i\u2019m finally back and more homosexual and transgender than ever. I\u2019m finally participating in Pride Month, and i\u2019ve decided to do this by making Pride Flag artwork for all of my OC\u2019s, as they all fall into different places within the LGBTQ+ community. Now, obviously, since i only have a handful of OC\u2019s, only a handful of identities will be represented within these artworks. THIS DOES NOT ERASE ALL OTHER IDENTITIES. I am a firm believer in the notion that everyone in this world deserves to be seen, loved, and accepted, no matter the differences between us. Unfortunately, i only have two hands, and drawing up a character for every identity out there would probably kill me. Just know that i love and accept all of you, even if i don\u2019t have an OC that matches with your identity. Another disclaimer: Flags have changed a lot during my lifetime. I am trying my best to research what flags are correct to use for what identities, and which ones are invalid or looked down upon in the community, but this topic is very complicated and i am very new to it. While i do put time and effort into making sure i am presenting my work in the most inoffensive and inclusive way possible, there is a good possibility that i may mess it up. If this does turn out to be the case, then i can only apologize. It is not my intention to promote harm or hate upon any member of any community. I am only human. And humans fuck up sometimes. With that all out of the way, let\u2019s kick off pride month with my main guy, Hadiah! Representing Transgender individuals like myself, and so many other amazing human beings who deserve all the love in the world. Songs used: There\u2019s Nothin\u2019 Holding Me Back - Shawn Mendes Unstoppable - The Score I have no ownership over these songs, i simply like them and wanted y\u2019all to be able to feel the same vibes i did while making this artwork.

Can you tell by the way she's dressed? If you want to get good with women (I mean REALLY good), if you want to know when to flirt, how to flirt, how to \"read the signs\" if she's into you or not, see the signs that she wants sex, build attraction, approach with ease... or even learn how to seduce the woman you are already with... Then my friend, you need to spend some time UNDERSTANDING WOMEN. And really digging into why women dress sexy is going to give you a powerful look inside of how women think, how women work, and help you to understand women when it comes to attraction, dating, sex, and relationships... Having these insights lets you flirt with a HUMAN, and not just an \"attractive target,\" and that will set you aside from 90% of the men out there. It's not about being a \"nice\" guy or an alpha guy or a seductive guy or a jerk... Because if you genuinely understand a woman... her desires and her insecurities, then you can show up with genuine confidence and honestly, this stuff gets EASY. I have thousands of clients who thought this was crazy... until they started getting results that were not only better and easier... but just so much more natural and enjoyable. It's time to learn how to flirt with a girl in a way that is relaxed, fun for both of you, and WORKS. This video doesn't have all the answers, but it's a first step to becoming that guy. Please leave comments and questions below and I'll do my best to drop in here and give you direct, no B.S. answers! Thanks!", "label": "harmless"}

He rose to prominence during the 1970s as the lead vocalist of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath, during which period he adopted the nickname \"Prince of Darkness\".[9] Osbourne was fired from Black Sabbath in 1979 due to alcohol and drug problems, but went on to have a successful solo career, releasing 12 studio albums, the first seven of which received multi-platinum certifications in the US. Osbourne has since reunited with Black Sabbath on several occasions. He rejoined in 1997 and helped record the group's final studio album, 13 (2013), before they embarked on a farewell tour that ended with a February 2017 performance in their hometown, Birmingham. His longevity and success have earned him the informal title \"Godfather of Metal\".[10] Osbourne's total album sales from his years in Black Sabbath, combined with his solo work, are over 100 million.[11][12] He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Black Sabbath and into the UK Music Hall of Fame as a solo artist and as a member of the band. He has been honoured with stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Birmingham Walk of Stars. At the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards, he received the Global Icon Award. In 2015, Osbourne received the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. In the early 2000s, Osbourne became a reality television star, appearing as himself in the MTV reality show The Osbournes alongside wife and manager Sharon and two of their three children, Kelly and Jack. He co-stars with Jack and Kelly in the television series Ozzy & Jack's World Detour. The show's third season debuted in June 2018. Osbourne was born at Marston Green Maternity Hospital near to Coleshill, but grew up in the Aston area of Birmingham.[8][13] His mother, Lilian (n\u00e9e Unitt; 1916\u20132001), was a non-observant Catholic who worked days at a Lucas factory.[14][15][16] His father, John Thomas \"Jack\" Osbourne (1915\u20131977), worked night shifts as a toolmaker at the General Electric Company.[17][18] Osbourne has three older sisters, Jean, Iris, and Gillian, and two younger brothers, Paul and Tony. The family lived in a small two-bedroom home at 14 Lodge Road in Aston. Osbourne has had the nickname \"Ozzy\" since primary school.[19] Osbourne dealt with dyslexia at school.[20] At the age of 11, he suffered sexual abuse from school bullies.[21] Osbourne claimed to have attempted suicide multiple times as a teenager.[22][23] He left school at 15 and was employed as a construction site labourer, trainee plumber, apprentice toolmaker, car factory horn-tuner, and abattoir worker. While young he dabbled in crime and spent six weeks in Winson Green Prison when he was unable to pay a fine after being convicted of burgling a clothes shop; to teach his son a lesson, his father refused to pay the fine.[17] Drawn to the stage, he took part in school plays such as Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado and HMS Pinafore.[24] He possesses a \"hesitant\" Brummie accent.[25] Upon hearing their first hit single at age 14, Osbourne became a fan of the Beatles. He credits their 1963 song \"She Loves You\" for inspiring him to become a musician.[18][26] He said in the 2011 documentary God Bless Ozzy Osbourne, \"I knew I was going to be a rock star the rest of my life.\"[27]", "label": "harmless"}

China and Russia are two world powers involved in spaceflight and they have decided to cooperate for lunar activities. On March 9, 2021 an autonomous lunar permanent research base was created by the collaboration of the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and Russian Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS). The two countries were able to do this using the Outer Space Treaty of 1967. The emphasis of the MoU is on scientific discovery and the use of lunar terrain. In this agreement, the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) was described as a comprehensive scientific research base having enough capability for long-term autonomous operations which will be built on the lunar surface or on the orbit of the moon with operations involving lunar exploration and utilization, lunar-based observation, basic scientific experiments, and technical verification.

They were the kings of slapstick, the masters of mayhem, and the epitome of comedy. The Three Stooges, a timeless trio that brought laughter to millions. They dominated the comedy scene. Their vaudeville-style humor was unmatched. But beneath the laughter, their films often tackled deeper themes: satire, social commentary, and the struggles of class. The Stooges were more than just clowns; they were artists who used comedy to reflect the world around them. While we remember them as a unified trio, the truth is that the cast of The Three Stooges changed over the years. Multiple actors stepped into the roles, each bringing their unique talents to the screen. Sadly, the laughter eventually faded, and we lost all six actors who graced the screen as these iconic characters. But today, we will delve deep into the lives, careers, and ultimately, the heartbreaking deaths of these beloved funny men. Let's get into it...", "label": "harmless"}

Peterson (born 12 June 1962) is a Canadian professor of psychology, clinical psychologist, YouTube personality, and author. He began to receive widespread attention in the late 2010s for his views on cultural and political issues, often described as conservative. Born and raised in Alberta, Peterson obtained bachelor's degrees in political science and psychology from the University of Alberta and a PhD in clinical psychology from McGill University. After teaching and research at Harvard University, he returned to Canada in 1998 to permanently join the faculty of psychology at the University of Toronto. In 1999, he published his first book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief, which became the basis for many of his subsequent lectures. The book combined information from psychology, mythology, religion, literature, philosophy, and neuroscience to analyze systems of belief and meaning. __________________________________________ Buy Jordan Peterson's New book : 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos - https://amzn.to/3onPjZY Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life - https://amzn.to/34vmp39 Jordan Peterson's Maps Of Meaning (Audiobook) - https://amzn.to/3HGUJqA Jordan Peterson's Maps Of Meaning (Paperback) - https://amzn.to/3HwE2OO Summary: 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos by Jordan B.

{"sentence": "With a heavy heart at the final farewell to actress Roseanne Barr, our deepest condolences With a heavy heart at the final farewell to actress Roseanne Barr, our deepest condolences #roseannebarr Roseanne Cherrie Barr (born November 3, 1952) is an American actress, comedian, writer, producer, and former presidential candidate. Barr began her career in stand-up comedy before gaining acclaim in the television sitcom Roseanne (1988\u20131997; 2018). She won an Emmy and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for her work on the show. Barr became a stand-up comedian in 1980. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, she gained fame through her role in Roseanne and other performances. Barr sparked controversy when performing \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at a nationally aired baseball game on July 25, 1990. After singing the anthem in what many perceived to be a deliberately disrespectful manner, Barr grabbed her groin and spat. This performance was met with condemnation from baseball fans and sportswriters, and was called \"disgraceful\" by then-President George H. W. Bush.[1] Barr has been active and outspoken on political issues. She won nearly 70,000 votes for president in the 2012 presidential election as the nominee of the left-wing Peace and Freedom Party.[2] After Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president in 2015, Kelly Weill of The Daily Beast wrote that Barr \"veered right\" in her politics.[3] After Roseanne was revived, Trump called her to congratulate her on her show's ratings and thank her for her support.[4] She has frequently defended her support of Trump, and has been criticized for making personal attacks and promoting conspiracy theories and fake news.[5] Roseanne was revived in 2018 on ABC. A ratings success, it was renewed for an additional season but was canceled after Barr made a controversial tweet condemned as racist by many commentators. Barr referred to the tweet as a \"bad joke\".[6] In 2022, she announced a comeback comedy special to be released on Fox Nation in 2023. In 1987, The Cosby Show executive producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner wanted to bring a \"no-perks family comedy\" to television. They hired Cosby writer Matt Williams to write a script about factory workers and signed Barr to play Roseanne Conner.[16] The show premiered on October 18, 1988, and was watched by 21.4 million households, making it the highest-rated debut of that season.[16] Barr became outraged when she watched the first episode of Roseanne and noticed that in the credits, Williams was listed as creator.[16] She told Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly, \"We built the show around my actual life and my kids. The 'domestic goddess', the whole thing.\"[16] In the same interview, Werner said, \"I don't think Roseanne, to this day, understands that this is something legislated by the Writers Guild, and it's part of what every show has to deal with. They're the final arbiters.\"[16] During the first season, Barr sought more creative control over the show, opposing Williams' authority. Barr refused to say certain lines and eventually walked off set. She threatened to quit the show if Williams did not leave. ABC let Williams go after the thirteenth episode.[16] Barr gave Amy Sherman-Palladino and Joss Whedon their first writing jobs on Roseanne.[17][18] Roseanne ran for nine seasons from 1988 to 1997. Barr won an Emmy, a Golden Globe, a Kids' Choice Award, and three American Comedy Awards for her part in the show. Barr had crafted a \"fierce working-class domestic goddess\" persona in the eight years preceding her sitcom and wanted to do a realistic show about a strong mother \"who was not a victim of patriarchal consumerism.\"[18] For the final two seasons, Barr earned $40 million, making her the second-highest-paid woman in show business at the time, after Oprah Winfrey. Barbara Ehrenreich called Barr a working-class spokesperson representing \"the hopeless underclass of the female sex: polyester-clad, overweight occupants of the slow track; fast-food waitresses, factory workers, housewives, members of the invisible pink-collar army; the despised, the jilted, the underpaid,\"[20] but a master of \"the kind of class-militant populism that the Democrats, most of them anyway, never seem to get right.\"[21] Barr refuses to use the term \"blue collar\" because it masks the issue of class.[22] During Roseanne's final season, Barr was in negotiations between Carsey-Werner Productions and ABC executives to continue playing Roseanne Conner in a spin-off.[23] After failed discussions with ABC as well as CBS and Fox, Carsey-Werner and Barr agreed not to continue the negotiations.[24] She released her autobiography in 1989, titled Roseanne\u2014My Life As a Woman.[25] That same year, she made her film debut in She-Devil, playing a scorned housewife, Ruth. Film critic Roger Ebert gave her a positive review saying, \"Barr could have made an easy, predictable and dumb comedy at any point in the last couple of years. Instead, she took her chances with an ambitious project\u2014a real movie.", "label": "harmless"}

For more Barbie Sports and Camping Crafts, check out Barbie\u2019s channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-n7zAIre5A AMAZING #BARBIE DIYs AND CRAFTS YOU SHOULD KNOW It\u2019s time to get crafty with Barbie and try out some brand new ideas and crafts! Please note that adult supervision is recommended here. We\u2019re taking Barbie out camping with her friends in her camper. It\u2019s got a pool with a slide, hammocks, beds, a kitchen, and even a bathroom, and she\u2019s driving it out to the campsite that we\u2019re going to make for her and her friends. Let\u2019s create the scenery for our fun Barbie adventure! Take a shoebox and cover it in non-toxic glue, then take a grass mat and place it on top. While it dries, use some more non-toxic glue and place moss on the box to create a landscape for your Barbie. Add little wooden sticks to serve as trees, and then move on to the campfire. Take an LED tea light candle and cover it with some artificial grass, attach little rocks all around it, and then small wooden pieces to make it resemble a fire. Then light it up using the back switch, and voila! Then let Barbie and her friends sit around the little fire to enjoy some outdoor time together! Another recycled craft can be made with an old eyeshadow container. Cut out a small piece of corrugated cardboard, place it in the eyeshadow container, and then you can use it as a grill for a fun barbeque! To give your Barbie a sparkly style, take a thin piece of glitter foam and carefully cut it with some safety scissors into an oval shape towards the edges. After that, attach another piece of foam to a zipper (follow the actions shown in the video!). When it dries, stick everything together to create a cute backpack for your Barbie. You can also add fun shapes to it, using either stickers or some more colorful foam. You can also repurpose some old pieces of fabric into an adorable sleeping bag for our camping adventure! Just follow the actions shown in the video. \u2026and more! There are so many cool crafts for Barbie and her friends in this video. Enjoy!

{"sentence": "Blue Origin's Secret Project To Copy SpaceX Starship Blue Origin's Secret Project To Copy SpaceX Starship (Project Jarvis). Although no one likes to admit it, companies steal ideas from each other all the time. Even the biggest names in the industry, such as Apple, have cribbed concepts that came from other places and found great success with them. The truth is that at one point or another just about everyone is going to mimic someone else in some way. The same is true for the modern day space race and the battle between billionaires to conquer the stars. Some of the biggest names in the world - such as Elon Musk, Richard Branson, and Jeff Bezos - are attempting to leave the biggest imprint on space travel. And, sure enough, it looks like they\u2019re starting to take one another's ideas and make them their own. Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin has been making waves lately and has been turning a lot of heads. The Amazon founder broke records when he was one of four passengers to actually ride on a New Shepard rocket into space. The short trip to space created millions of headlines and was a major boom to Bezos and his desire to one-up Musk and others. After years of sitting in second place, Blue Origin had a lot more wind in its sails. But people aren\u2019t just talking about Bezos and space flight.

{"sentence": "10 minutes ago / With singer Robert Plant's tearful final farewell, he was confirmed as.. 10 minutes ago / With singer Robert Plant's tearful final farewell, he was confirmed as.. #robertplant #robertpattinson Robert Anthony Plant CBE (born 20 August 1948) is an English singer and songwriter, best known as the lead singer and lyricist of the English rock band Led Zeppelin for all of its existence from 1968 until 1980, when the band broke up following the death of John Bonham, the band's drummer. He was inducted with the band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. Plant enjoyed great success with Led Zeppelin from the late 1960s to the end of the 1970s. He developed a compelling image as the charismatic rock-and-roll front man, similar to those of contemporaries such as Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones, Roger Daltrey of the Who, Jim Morrison of the Doors, and Freddie Mercury of Queen.[2] After Led Zeppelin dissolved in 1980, Plant continued to perform and record continuously on a variety of solo and group projects. His first well known post-Led Zeppelin project was The Honeydrippers, alongside former Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, among others. In 1988, he released the solo album Now and Zen, which spawned the hit singles \"Tall Cool One\" and \"Ship of Fools\". In the 1990s, another reunion project named Page and Plant released two studio albums and a live album from an MTV Unplugged performance, as well as winning the Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 1998 for \"Most High\". In 2007, he began a collaboration with bluegrass artist Alison Krauss, releasing the album Raising Sand, which won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 2009 and produced the hit song \"Please Read the Letter\", which won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year the same year. In 2010, he revived the Band of Joy (which shared its name with an early band he performed with in the 1960s), and in 2012 formed a new band, the Sensational Space Shifters, followed by a reunion with Alison Krauss in 2019. In 2008, Rolling Stone editors ranked him number 15 on their list of the 100 best singers of all time.[3] In 2011, Rolling Stone readers ranked Plant the greatest of all lead singers.[4] In 2006, Hit Parader magazine named Plant the \"Greatest Metal Vocalist of All Time\".[5] In 2009, Plant was voted \"the greatest voice in rock\" in a poll conducted by Planet Rock. Robert Anthony Plant was born on 20 August 1948, in the Black Country town of West Bromwich, Staffordshire, England, to Robert C. Plant, a qualified civil engineer who worked in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War,[8] and Annie Celia Plant (n\u00e9e Cain), a Romani woman.[9][10][11][12] He grew up in the Hayley Green area of Halesowen, Worcestershire.[13] Plant gained an interest in singing and rock and roll music at an early age; in an interview with Andrew Denton on the Denton talk show in 1994, Plant stated his desire, as a ten-year-old, to be like Elvis Presley: When I was a kid I used to hide behind the curtains at home at Christmas and I used to try and be Elvis. There was a certain ambience between the curtains and the French windows, there was a certain sound there for a ten-year-old. That was all the ambience I got at ten years old ... And I always wanted to be ... a bit similar to that[14] He left King Edward VI Grammar School for Boys in Stourbridge in his mid-teens and developed a strong passion for the blues, mainly through his admiration for Willie Dixon, Robert Johnson and early renditions of songs in this genre. I suppose I was quite interested in my stamp collection and Romani-British history. I was a little grammar school boy and I could hear this kind of calling through the airwaves.[15] He abandoned training as a chartered accountant after only two weeks to attend college in an effort to gain more GCE passes and to become part of the English Midlands blues scene.[16][17] \"I left home at 16\", he said, \"and I started my real education musically, moving from group to group, furthering my knowledge of the blues and of other music which had weight and was worth listening to\".", "label": "harmless"}

Using a completely aligned space telescope, the European Space Agency has unveiled ten jaw-dropping new high-definition images of stars taken by the Webb Telescope, showing it is capable of taking razor-sharp images of the universe, with precision even beyond the wildest hopes of its designers. With a large 6.5-meter primary mirror capable of detecting the dim light of far-away stars and galaxies, the James Webb Space Telescope is the most ambitious and sophisticated space telescope ever built. Its main purpose is to detect infrared light emitted by distant stars, planets, and gas clouds.

Wenn ihr damit nicht konfrontiert werden m\u00f6chtet, dann lest bitte nicht weiter. Auf euren Wunsch hin findet ihr hier jetzt die ganze Doku. Wir freuen uns \u00fcber euer Interesse und sind eurer Anregung gern gefolgt. Mehr als f\u00fcnf Millionen Menschen sind bundesweit j\u00e4hrlich von einer Depression betroffen. Die Krankheit kann jede und jeden treffen. Und doch gibt es noch immer viele Vorurteilen gegen\u00fcber Betroffenen. Depressive werden allzu oft als wehleidig, unmotiviert, sogar als faul angesehen. S\u00e4tze wie \u201eStell dich doch nicht so an\u201c oder \u201eLach doch mal\u201c geh\u00f6ren bei vielen Erkrankten zum Alltag. Die Depression wird als potenziell t\u00f6dliche Erkrankung bis heute gef\u00e4hrlich untersch\u00e4tzt. Die NDR Reporter*innen Marie-Caroline Chlebosch und Marco Schulze treffen vier Menschen in ihrem herausfordernden Alltag, begleiten sie in der Therapie, in der Klinik, in der Selbsthilfe. Sie zeigen: Jede Depression anders. Von leichten Tagen bis zum Kampf gegen Suizidgedanken. Und sie sprechen \u00fcber die Stigmatisierung, die Betroffenen noch allzu oft begegnet.

{"sentence": "Helping The Homeless **Christmas Special** Hey everyone, it's that time of the year again. This is by far my favorite series on this channel. This is officially the 3rd year now where we went out to help those in need. Last season we were lucky enough to meet West and help him change his life around. Unfortunately during the filming of this video West was in the hospital getting a small surgery/recovering from it. Never the less, in this video we managed to give back to the community of Toronto, Ontario. We met a lot of great people and learned a lot! As of uploading, this video 70 homeless people died this year in the streets of Toronto due to extreme cold weathers. (http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/homeless-deaths-toronto-public-health-update-1.4378532) The goal for this series \u201cAnother Chance\u201d is to give back to those who may need it more than others. Especially around this time of the year, the world chooses to spend a ton of money to give to others but people on the streets are usually forgotten. I am thrilled that we were able to make this video and super happy that CSGOLive was down to help as well. We also met Savage SAM, who is an artist in Toronto. He mentioned that he was here to help a Mother find her lost child. Which is incredible because he sacrificed his life and funds just to see his friend reunite with her lost child. It was super awesome that he was grateful for everything, and even more thrilling that he was going to spend his funds to give back to others.

{"sentence": "Benefits of Decalcifying the Pineal Gland (Ajna Chakra) In the East Indian tradition, the third eye is referred to as the 'antar-guru,' the seat of the 'teacher inside.\" This is why Indians put a bindi or tilak on their third eye, to aid in concentration. Moreoever, decalcifying the third eye through proper diet and clean living allows one to secrete more melatonin and DMT, thereby gaining wisdom and unique experiences such as astral projection or shamanic insights. I'm sure it sounds quite bizarre, but I've an experience like those of my own. Decalcifying the pineal gland is an aspect of building up spiritual strength that ever artist and entrepreneur should incorporate. ---------------------------------------------- https://www.instagram.com/nrajapandey ---------------------------------------------- Book Mentioned: https://www.amazon.com/Pineal-Gland-Third-Eye-Methods-ebook/dp/B0064GMJQM", "label": "harmless"}

Let me start out by introducing myself. My name is Ibrahim but people call me Ibbyy for short, much easier to pronounce also... I was born and raised in a small country called Bulgaria but moved to Canada when i was about 13... I've been into video games since I can remember, and I finally decided to make a YouTube channel where I can share my tips, tricks, game-plays, and also other stuff that relate to gaming. Every now and then I also post Vlog's and other videos that might interest you... At the moment my goal is to reach 100,000 subscribers and so far it has been an uphill struggle. I am focused and plan to make my goals come true. With that said, on this channel I do my best to upload at least 1 video a day! I really do enjoy YouTube and providing content for others to watch and one day if all goes well I might even make this my full time job. For now though, I graduated from College and now I'm enrolled in University trying to complete that as well. Thank you for checking my bio, as well as watching my video.. If there is anything you would like to suggest feel free to leave a comment on the video! If you would like to see me play a game, PLEASE LET ME KNOW! Also this channel does accept user submitted clips, if you have something awesome you would want me to share...

Although space may appear to some to be the final frontier, scientists are still actively discovering new things about our own little planet, including the mysteries that exist beneath its surface. A molten outer core surrounded by a highly packed ball of solid iron alloy has been widely accepted by scientists for more than half a century. However, new research provides a rare glimpse into the planet's interior structure, far stranger than previously assumed. Eratosthenes, a Greek polymath, made the first measurement of the distance around the Earth's sphere more than 2,200 years ago, and it has been evident ever since that it must have a center.

Here are the reasons why women don't text you back and lose interest and you're gonna be woken up to a rude reality. Look, man, there's a reason why she doesn't like you. The first reason is that your game was weak. The reason why she didn't text you back was that your game was weak. The next thing (which is in the same point) is in regards to your daily life. Rather than your game is weak, you're just nobody in life. You are the worst student, you're the worst basketball player, you're the worst artist in your school--you're the worst in everywhere you go. You're not good at anything and you have no social capital, you have nothing to offer. You might be an unattractive guy but I promise you, if you're good at something then she'll call you back. The third one is that she wasn't interested but she doesn't want to hurt your feelings. That happens often when women are not interested in you but they don't want to make you feel bad. That would get a lot of guys sort of fucked in the head because they're in the mindset of trusting appearances. The fourth one is that you were coming on too strong and maybe it was intimidating here. You didn't give her her space and you try too hard. That's one of the reasons why she didn't call or text you back: maybe you just freaked her out. You acted too comfortable around her. What you got to do is give women space because if you don't, the same girl that likes you will instantly not like you. The next thing is that she didn't want to have an awkward moment of rejecting you. See, some guys get violent when they get rejected by women so a lot of women use that as a defense mechanism and they just say yes to the dudes just so that dude could leave her alone. The last one is she changed her mind. She just changed her mind. Have you done that with people, when you liked them then the next day you don't? It even happens when you wanna buy something and when you bought it you then want to return it. Women change their minds a lot more often so don't be surprised when a woman likes you one day and then she changes her mind--it's just how it is. Another thing is SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND. Let me tell you something about boyfriend guys: the better you are at game, the fewer boyfriends women have (if you know what I'm saying).

{"sentence": "James Webb Telescope Just Captured First Ever, Real Image Before Big Bang The universe witnessed a stunning cosmic expansion before the Big Bang; doubling in size at least 80 times in a fraction of a second. Because of this tremendous inflation, the cosmos became barren and frigid. That's when the cosmos stopped growing in size and the vacuum energy transformed into matter and radiation, ushering in the Big Bang's era of intense heat and density, forging the elemental building blocks that would eventually coalesce into the galaxies and stars we see today. Now, for the first time, the James Webb Space Telescope has peered into the distant past of the universe, and we have made a discovery so unexpected that it presents challenges to our understanding of the cosmos.

No longer is his schedule a maze of honey do errands. His mind is clear of memes that sap energy and time. Free to think, to study, to imagine and plan. It is my hope that men not only break away from the matrix but use that time and energy to build. Your life will be judged by how well you used your time on this planet. Use it wisely.

It involves my grandfather, who was the epitome of an alpha male. He passed away 16 years ago, and during his final months he told my aunt, despite having nearly a 60-year marriage, that if your mom (his wife) wants or tries to live with you, don't let her. She is difficult to live with. This is not to say that I don't love my grandma. She is amazing in many ways, although I was amazed at how he was able to have a marriage and successful marriage with a woman that was so different from the man he was, which was a Marine, a personnel manager and an overall red-pilled man. Here's what I learned: 1) Don\u2019t wait for the truths that you have to become truths because of old age 2) Screw the notion that a marriage is where happiness is found 3) My third point: It\u2019s a straight up sacrifice. You have to give yourself away in order to actually keep a marriage afloat.", "label": "harmful"}

{"sentence": "Sending 1,000 Starships To Mars All At Once Sending 1,000 Starships To Mars All At Once. When the technology industry gained Elon Musk, it gained a great mind with a clear vision. Like most great minds, the legend has made some mind-boggling declarations that have had most people worried for him. The advent of his space exploration company saw Musk make more of these strong declarations and interestingly, achieve most of them. No matter how long his track record of excellence gets, most people will not take his Mars agenda seriously until he actually accomplishes it. Musk wants to see Mars added to the Earth's rulership and he is working very hard towards it. His new spaceship, Starship, is already under production and several prototypes have been tested in the past year. What exactly does Musk aim to achieve with his determination to launch a thousand of these spacecraft to Mars at once?

{"sentence": "The Tesla CyberTruck 2022 Update is FINALLY Here The Tesla CyberTruck 2022 Update is FINALLY Here. The year was 2019 and Elon Musk proudly took to the stage to show off all that his Tesla car company had to offer. There was a lot on the docket and all of it was met with massive fanfare. Tesla had a slew of new electric vehicles in development, many of which are now gracing the roadways of the world, turning heads, and setting trends. Tesla has made good on many of the promises it made. However, there is one area where Tesla has fallen short with one particular product that has yet to become reality. We are talking about the Tesla CyberTruck of course. The proposed vehicle made quite a splash when it was introduced back in 2019. Some people mocked its design, while others said it looked like something ahead-of-its-time and straight out of a science fiction movie. But most everyone agreed that the Tesla CyberTruck was going to change the way things operate - yet again. The CyberTruck stood the chance to radically revolutionize the way that modern trucks look and work. Like it had done so many times before, Tesla was about to change the game. Now here we are a couple years later and no one is driving a CyberTruck. What gives? What\u2019s happening with this grand, futuristic vehicle? Although it\u2019s not the news we were all waiting for, we finally have some clarity on the road ahead for the Tesla CyberTruck. That\u2019s right, after all this time, Tesla has finally given a morsel of information to its eager fan base. So, is the CyberTruck right around the corner?

We report extremely sad news about 71-year-old actress Jane Seymour, she has been confirmed as.... #janeseymour Jane Seymour (born Joyce Penelope Wilhelmina Frankenberg; 15 February 1951) is an English actress. After making her screen debut as an uncredited extra in the 1969 musical comedy Oh! What a Lovely War, Seymour transitioned to leading roles in film and television, including a leading role in the television series The Onedin Line (1972\u20131973) and the role of psychic Bond girl Solitaire in the James Bond film Live and Let Die (1973). Critical acclaim followed with a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for Captains and the Kings (1976). In 1982, Seymour won her first Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Miniseries or Television Film for the miniseries East of Eden (1981). She received additional Golden Globe nominations in the same category for the television film The Woman He Loved (1988), in which she portrayed Wallis Simpson, and the miniseries War and Remembrance (1988-1989), for which she was nominated twice consecutively in addition to receiving another Emmy nomination. By this time, Seymour had won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for Onassis: The Richest Man in the World (1988), in which she played Maria Callas. In 1993, Seymour was cast as Dr. Michaela Quinn in the television series Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman, a medical drama set in the Wild West which ran for 6 seasons and resulted in a further two Emmy nominations and four Golden Globe nominations, including one win. Seymour was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame[1] and, in 2000, was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire.[2] Seymour's other film roles include Somewhere in Time (1980), The Scarlet Pimpernel (1982), La R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise (1989), Wedding Crashers (2005), Love, Wedding, Marriage (2011), Little Italy (2018), The War with Grandpa (2020) and Friendsgiving (2020). In addition to her acting career, Seymour is the founder of the Open Hearts Foundation as well as an author, having (co-)written several children's books and self-help books. Under the Jane Seymour Designs label, she has created jewellery, scarves, furniture, rugs, handbags, paintings and sculptures. Joyce Penelope Wilhelmina Frankenberg was born on 15 February 1951[3] in Uxbridge, Middlesex (now part of Greater London), England, to Mieke van Tricht (1914\u20132007), a nurse, and Benjamin John Frankenberg FRCOG (1914\u20131990), a distinguished gynaecologist and obstetrician.[4][5][6] Her father was Jewish; he was born in England, to a family from Nowe Trzepowo, a village in Poland.[7] Her mother was a Dutch Protestant (with family from Deventer) who was a prisoner of war during World War II and had lived in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia).[8][9][10] Seymour has stated she learned Dutch from her mother and her fellow survivors from the Japanese internment camp, who frequently spent holidays together in the Netherlands when she was a child. Encouraged by her parents (who sent her to live with family friends in Geneva to practise her languages), she learned to speak fluent French.[11] Seymour's paternal grandfather Lee Grahame had come to live in the East End of London after escaping the Czarist pogroms when he was 14. He is listed in the 1911 census as living in Bethnal Green working as a hairdresser and went on to establish his own company.[12] Seymour's father Benjamin qualified at the UCL Medical School in 1938.[13][14][15] He joined the medical branch of the RAFVR after the outbreak of war, serving in England, Belgium, Italy and South Africa,[4] ending his service as a squadron leader with a mention in despatches.[14] After the war, Frankenberg continued his career at various London hospitals, including St Leonard's Hospital, Hackney, the East End Maternity Hospital, the City of London Maternity Hospital and finally Hillingdon Hospital, for which he designed the maternity unit.[4] A close associate of Patrick Steptoe, he assisted in pioneering discussions on in-vitro fertilisation and published papers on adolescent and teenage sexual behaviours.[4] Seymour was educated at Tring Park School for the Performing Arts in Hertfordshire. She chose the screen name Jane Seymour, after the English queen Jane Seymour, because it seemed more saleable.[8] One of Seymour's notable features is heterochromia, making her right eye brown and her left eye green.[16]", "label": "harmful"}

Beautiful photos of Jupiter reveal the planet to be covered entirely with striped, turbulent clouds. In actuality, storms are all over this planet. Some are only tiny, while others are enormous and could completely cover all of Earth. But the bands' depth was unknown for a very long time. Recent research revealed that the stripes extended to a depth of 3,000 kilometers, which was remarkably deep.

The Apollo 11 mission in 1969 was extraordinary when humans first landed there. But things have changed, and advancements have made a lunar mission more feasible. A renowned scientist, Michio Kaku has recently shared his thoughts on efforts to recreate that historic feat. China has taken a noteworthy step by sending a robotic spacecraft to collect lunar samples. This development adds intrigue to the ongoing lunar exploration saga.Meanwhile, Michio Kaku extended his congratulations to China for this remarkable achievement, emphasizing that they have now become the third country to accomplish this feat, following the United States and the Soviet Union. It's intriguing how they seem to be emulating the U.S.'s footsteps while taking shortcuts to make impressive progress.

{"sentence": "The Frightening Reality Of Tesla's Robot The Frightening Reality Of Tesla's Robot. Some of the most popular science fiction films and novels of all time show us a world that is overrun by relentless robots hellbent on making humanity a thing of the past. Like millions of other people, you\u2019ve probably seen films such as The Terminator or The Matrix. These movies gave us a future that is filled with nasty scientific inventions that rise up against those who created them. Yes, the robot apocalypse is an ageless trope that has been used again and again as a way to scare audiences...and perhaps warn them of what\u2019s to come. In 2017, a coalition of technology leaders came together to write a warning to the United Nations about so-called \u201ckiller robots\u201d and unchecked artificial intelligence. The letter stated that the robots of the future \u201cwill permit armed conflict to be fought at a scale greater than ever, and at timescales faster than humans can comprehend.\u201d \u201cWe do not have long to act,\u201d the letter continued. \u201cOnce this Pandora\u2019s box is opened, it will be hard to close.\u201d Over 100 leaders in the field signed the letter, one of them being none other than Elon Musk. So, it\u2019s a bit surprising to see that Elon Musk and his company Tesla just introduced a brand-new robot of their own. Dubbed \u201cOptimus\u201d, the 5-foot-8, 125-pound robot will be able to assist you around the house and make your life easier. Or so Musk says\u2026 What is it about AI that freaks us out so much, and why has Elon Musk changed his stance on the future of robots?

{"sentence": "DANIEL HARMS - \"DRILLER\" (2024) (Dark Ambient) DANIEL HARMS - \"DRILLER\" A grotesque scenery in a hostile place, amidst a provocative and enigmatic scene lies a depiction of a woman exploring unconventional pleasures within a grotesque setting. Through haunting flashes and the interplay of raw emotions, witness the convergence of hard-hitting violence and a primal form of eroticism. The woman, moving in sync with the primitive rhythmic beats of the track, becomes immersed in a pursuit of lust and freedom in their most primal and unfiltered forms, surrendering to desires and giving herself wholly to the experience. This evocative visual narrative challenges perceptions, inviting contemplation on the intricate connections between liberation, desire, and the allure of the forbidden. \"Driller\" is written and recorded by Daniel Harms in 2024 Links: Web: www.Daniel-Harms.com IG Art: www.Instagram.com/W0lfsblut IG Photo: www.Instagram.com/Lipstick_Glitch BandCamp: https://danielharms.bandcamp.com Twitter: DanHarms80 Post@Daniel-Harms.com #AmbientDesires #SurrealEncounter #PrimalRhythms #EtherealJourney #RawEmotions #ProvocativeNarrative #EroticExploration #SensualBeats #SurrealAesthetics #LiberatingDesires #ForbiddenPleasures #VisceralExperience #LustfulRhythms #ExploringBoundaries", "label": "harmful"}

To me, MGTOW is peace. It's rest and it's life speed. \ud83c\udf04 \u201cMGTOW is Cynical\u201d Had a discussion with someone who was very critical of MGTOW and calling the perspective cynical. I say that\u2019s really missing the point, I just can\u2019t maintain the effort and it\u2019s not worth it for me. Cynical is the wrong way to describe it...it\u2019s more realistic. Is it worth hunting and courting the NAWALT? Nah. What are the NAWALT chances? Very low. I explain the risks, reality of people changing, chameleon nature, honeymoon phase, drama and his response, \u201cWell, I\u2019m willing to take that risk.\u201d Okay man, I think hope it works out for you\u2026 \ud83c\udf04 Bunch of bitter dudes\u2026 I\u2019m not sure how you would sum up the issue or drill into it, but what got me thinking was from talking to an old friend of mine that I haven\u2019t spoken to for several years. He\u2019s 46 like me, and he\u2019s been rolled by women as badly as I have his whole life. So, he should know what I know, and be awake as I am -- he\u2019s had practically identical experiences and dated tons of women like I did. So, after a discussion about the woes and horrors of dating, I put him on to the MGTOW thing and give him some of my favorite content providers. He just comes back with this: \u201cSeems like a bunch of bitter dudes wanting some bromance time around a campfire.\u201d So, I guess some men you just can\u2019t wake up...It seems actually futile to try to wake up men in your real physical life as all you\u2019ll ever get are shaming lines and blue pilled mockery. I\u2019m amazed and literally thankful to God that I\u2019m red pilled and awake -- this is actually grace from God, that\u2019s how I see it; I could have been left in the darkness longing for something that literally doesn\u2019t exist. ---------------- Some cynicism is healthy, and I would say that I\u2019m more cynical than I am positive. The thing is, I won\u2019t take that statement further, because being positive and being cynical can\u2019t be compared against each other. The world thinks that they oppose each other, but rather, being cynical adds to one\u2019s joy in my eyes. I\u2019ve always described myself as having positive pessimism. Actually, the more cynical I am about something, the more that I can appreciate anything and the more that I can appreciate the times that they cynicism wasn\u2019t in fact needed. Also, cynicism is understood as being aggressive and cold. Rather, cynicism is being discerning and is a tool used to look out for one\u2019s self. ONLY. What\u2019s assumed if a man is going MGTOW and he\u2019s abstaining from relations with women, not marrying, not dating -- going his own way -- it\u2019s assumed that he is not engaging in any sense with human beings and is taking his money and storing it away in the ground. The immediate connection that is made is that, cynicism once equals cynicism only. Cynicism often is MGTOW, and the world is giving us great reason for it to be often. All that it is, is self preservation. #hoodiesup", "label": "harmful"}

Dissonance, a lack of harmony in whatever area that we are talking about. This could be what we think, although it is derived from music first. Cognitive dissonance occurs when we think or believe two things that go against each other. They contradict, but out of fear of losing either, we accept both even though one of them can really exist. They can\u2019t exist together. And that is the comparison that I\u2019m making when you take the red pill and you think of love or romance in the frame of mind that it is presented today.

You need to identify this because if you don't, and the female psychos catch you, you're fucked. The first sign of a psycho is giving you names in the beginning. Say no to nicknames because it's a way of branding you. Another sign is the super happy smiles! Oversmiling is a huge problem. There's also always a difference in her emotions from yours. There's also nothing wrong with gifts but if she wants to do the matching sheez--don't do that. She would also talk about family. The problem is, just because she's hot, you let her get away with it. You got to be direct with people. When a woman tells you something, trying to speed things up, you got to slow it down. You can't let a woman dictate the phase of the relationship.

That's right my friends. 23 hours! Officially the longest game movie on our channel. You can always watch it in smaller parts in the link below. 24 hours is the current YouTube limit and I was worried that we would pass that threshold, but we just made it. Assassin's Creed: Valhalla has 3 main story arcs in the game: the main story, the Order of the Ancients and the Asgard arc. All three are completed here and it wraps up nicely. This has 100% completion of pacifying all the kingdoms in England. And there is still a ton to do if we wanted to keep playing. This game is massive! As always we included important dialogue, relevant gameplay and all cutscenes to stitch together a fluid cinematic experience. We hope you enjoy! As a young child, Eivor was forced to witness the death of their parents at the hands of the rogue Viking warlord Kjotve the Cruel. Eighteen years later, an adult Eivor continues their pursuit of Kjotve to take revenge on him. While their latest attempt fails, they are at least able to recover their father's axe. Upon touching the axe, Eivor experiences a vivid vision of Odin. Curious about the vision, Eivor consults the local mystic Valka. Valka induces another vision in Eivor that shows Sigurd missing an arm before a giant wolf attacks both him and Eivor. Valka interprets the vision as a prophecy that Eivor will eventually betray Sigurd, which Eivor remains skeptical of.

{"sentence": "Donnie Causes His Teacher To Become Pregnant  | That\u2019s My Boy Recapped Title: That's My Boy Genre: Comedy Release Year: 2012 Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 \"That's My Boy\" is a raucous comedy that certainly doesn't hold back in delivering its outrageous humor. Directed by Sean Anders and starring Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg, this film takes a dive into the world of dysfunction, absurdity, and the chaos that can be unleashed when a man-child tries to reconnect with his estranged son. The story revolves around Donny Berger (Adam Sandler), a middle-aged man with a penchant for immaturity and bad decisions. After fathering a child with his teacher at the ripe age of 13, Donny raises his son, Todd (Andy Samberg), on his own, creating a rather unconventional upbringing. Fast forward to the present day, and Todd has distanced himself from his father, adopting a new identity and cutting ties with his past. However, Donny reenters Todd's life on the eve of his wedding, threatening to unravel everything. The film's comedy is unapologetically crude, and it primarily relies on shock value and absurdity to get its laughs. Adam Sandler's portrayal of Donny is classic Sandler\u2014outrageous, obnoxious, and sometimes endearing. Andy Samberg's Todd is the perfect foil to Sandler's antics, as he attempts to maintain some semblance of normalcy amidst the chaos. While \"That's My Boy\" has its moments of hilarity, it's important to note that its humor often ventures into cringe-worthy and tasteless territory. Some viewers may find it difficult to appreciate the film's brand of comedy, especially if they're not fans of the crude and over-the-top style that Adam Sandler is known for. Despite its shortcomings in terms of humor, the film does attempt to explore themes of father-son relationships, redemption, and growing up. These moments provide some depth to an otherwise shallow comedy. If you're a fan of Adam Sandler's irreverent style of comedy and can appreciate humor that pushes boundaries, \"That's My Boy\" might be an enjoyable watch for you. However, if you prefer more subtle or sophisticated humor, this film may not be your cup of tea. \"That's My Boy\" is available for streaming on various platforms like Amazon Prime Video, iTunes, and Vudu. It's worth a watch if you're in the mood for mindless laughter and aren't easily offended by crass humor. Just be prepared for a wild and occasionally uncomfortable ride through the world of Donny Berger and his dysfunctional family.

{"sentence": "Why Do Women Rule Men? - MGTOW Why Women Rule Men - MGTOW Sponsor Link: Luminous YouTube Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTUoWGhij1YMK5MIZ-eL1eQ? MGTOW Mystery Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YveGDnkVXk Brave Browser: https://brave.com/san644 Hi Everyone Sandman Here, This video is brought to you by a donation from Mr. Anonymous and here's what he has to say: \"Hello Sandman, Your content is excellent and worth supporting even if it is in a modest way. Would it be possible for you to discuss why MGTOW are walking away from religion? I am a Pentecostal MGTOW and receive a lot of verbal persecution for being single. Women are the majority in most Pentecostal churches and by design control the churches. They are exceptionally controlling and brazen in their desire to rule over the men in the congregation. This is driving the men away from the church. MGTOW are held in great disdain and fear because they cannot be controlled by the fantasy of the golden vagina. Most men refuse to tolerate this and simply leave the building as you have often said. There is a very aggressive campaign being waged by the United Pentecostal Church International as well as most religions to ordain as many females as preachers and pastors as quickly as possible. It's the cause dujour as well as diversity, including mixed marriages. I Timothy 3 clearly states that the bishopric (pastor) is to be the husband of one wife. Yet, they are ordaining women as pastors at an alarming rate. Thank you for considering this topic on BitChute.\" Well Mr. Anonymous thanks for the donation and topic. But before I get to it let me first tell you about today's sponsor Luminous Let's Play: Anyways, now back Mr. Anonymous and why men are leaving Christianity as we saw more and more female ministers being ordained. This comes down to women dominating as many spaces as possible. Churches aren't true male spaces because both sexes are welcome yet women are still trying to dominate them. Why can't they share? It's not simply about conrolling the narrative in a traditionally male space. The propaganda is only the beginning. Once an environment has been completely tone policed and become politically correct then women move into to positions of authority. Then men begin leaving as you mentioned Mr. Anonymous because they don't have the freedom to express their opinions without constantly walking on eggshells and eventually the message gets watered down by the female preachers. Their sermons being written to be more politically correct. What I've just outlined in your house of worship can also be seen in the geek house of worship which was once Lucasfilm. We see this with Kathleen Kennedy running it into the ground. Women fight for power in cultural, religious, political and economic institutions. 10 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com.

{"sentence": "Brian Greene: \"We FINALLY Saw What's Inside A Supermassive Black Hole!\" Space-based black holes are areas where a tremendous amount of mass is crammed into a very small space. As a result, there is an intense gravitational force that prevents even light from escaping. They are produced through the collapse of massive stars, as well as possibly by unidentified other processes. Scientists and the general public are equally fascinated by black holes because they test our knowledge of matter, space, and time. Black holes have assisted researchers in learning a great deal about our universe, but there is still a great deal we don't understand about these incredible cosmic occurrences.

{"sentence": "We report extremely sad news about 75 year old legend Arnold Schwarzenegger, goodbye and rest. We report extremely sad news about 75 year old legend Arnold Schwarzenegger, goodbye and rest. #arnoldschwarzenegger Arnold Schwarzenegger (born July 30, 1947) is an Austrian-American actor, film producer, businessman, retired professional bodybuilder and politician who served as the 38th governor of California between 2003 and 2011. As of 2022, he is the most recent Republican governor of California. Time magazine named Schwarzenegger one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2004 and 2007.[1][2] Schwarzenegger began lifting weights at the age of 15 and went on to win the Mr. Universe title at age 20 and subsequently won the Mr. Olympia title seven times. He is widely regarded as either the greatest[3] or one of the two greatest bodybuilders of all time along with Ronnie Coleman,[4] and has written many books and articles about bodybuilding.[5] The Arnold Sports Festival, considered the second-most important bodybuilding event after Mr. Olympia, is named after him.[6] He appeared in the bodybuilding documentary Pumping Iron (1977). Schwarzenegger retired from bodybuilding and gained worldwide fame as a Hollywood action star, with his breakthrough in the sword and sorcery epic Conan the Barbarian (1982), a box-office hit with a sequel in 1984.[7] After playing the title character in the science fiction film The Terminator (1984), he starred in the sequels Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003), Terminator Genisys (2015), and Terminator: Dark Fate (2019). His other successful action films included Commando (1985), The Running Man (1987), Predator (1987), Red Heat (1988), Total Recall (1990), and True Lies (1994), in addition to comedy films such as Twins (1988), Kindergarten Cop (1990), Junior (1994), and Jingle All the Way (1996).[8] He is the founder of the film production company Oak Productions.[9] As a Republican candidate, Schwarzenegger was first elected on October 7, 2003, in a special recall election to replace then-Governor Gray Davis. He received 48.6% of the vote, 17 points ahead of Democrat runner-up Cruz Bustamante. He was sworn in on November 17 to serve the remainder of Davis' term, and was re-elected in the 2006 California gubernatorial election with an increased vote share of 55.9% to serve a full term as governor.[10] In 2011, he reached his term limit as governor and returned to acting. Schwarzenegger was nicknamed the \"Austrian Oak\" in his bodybuilding days, \"Arnie\" or \"Schwarzy\" during his acting career,[11] and \"the Governator\" (a portmanteau of \"Governor\" and \"Terminator\") during his political career. He married Maria Shriver, a niece of President John F. Kennedy, in 1986. They separated in 2011 after he admitted to having fathered a child with their housemaid in 1997; their divorce was finalized in 2021. Arnold Schwarzenegger was born in Thal, Austria on July 30, 1947,[13] the second son of Gustav Schwarzenegger and his wife, Aurelia (n\u00e9e Jadrny). Schwarzenegger's father was the local chief of police. After the Anschluss in 1938, he joined the Nazi Party and, in 1939 the Sturmabteilung (SA). In World War II, he served as a military policeman in the invasions of Poland, France and the Soviet Union, including the siege of Leningrad, rising to the rank of Hauptfeldwebel.[14][15] He was wounded in the Battle of Stalingrad,[16] and was discharged in 1943 following a bout of malaria. According to Holocaust scholar Michael Berenbaum, Gustav Schwarzenegger served \"in theaters of the war where atrocities were committed. But there is no way to know from the documents whether he played a role.\"[14] Gustav's background received wide press attention during the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election in which Schwarzenegger was elected governor.[17] Gustav Schwarzenegger married Aurelia on October 20, 1945; he was 38 and she was 23. According to Schwarzenegger, his parents were very strict: \"Back then in Austria it was a very different world [...] if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents, the rod was not spared.\"[18] He grew up in a Catholic family.[19] Gustav preferred his elder son, Meinhard, over Arnold.[20] His favoritism was \"strong and blatant\", which stemmed from unfounded suspicion that Arnold was not his biological child.[21] Schwarzenegger has said that his father had \"no patience for listening or understanding your problems\".[19] He had a good relationship with his mother, with whom he kept in touch until her death.", "label": "harmful"}

For the past few decades, the Milky Way and our neighboring Andromeda galaxy have been on a high-speed collision course. Scientists had earlier thought that this collision would take a few billion years, but they were wrong.

{"sentence": "Honest Women LOL - MGTOW \"Hello again, I need to do some explaining the way women speak. The first is quality which is very poor. As women we speak barely any usable information and also we won't state problem at hand. Second we speak in high quantities. We give too much information and this causes an overload in people's filtering systems. For example a women pointing out a hundred things she might want as a present. And what you to buy is mostly done in hints. This will create irritating guessing games for men and will also irritate women if you guess it wrong. This is the best you can hope for. The second way women speak falls away from information and it's basically lying or withholding information. It gives us multiple advantages. For example a woman never lies, it's just the man that never asked and therefore is to blame. Also there is a high plausibility a woman will not be found out as well. Advanced female manipulators will make men act out in rage and can therefore claim to be victims. And the third way women communicate is by telling the truth. It happens so seldom that people will make up ulterior motives. In the event a woman does get in trouble she has easy access to white knights and fellow women who will do the fighting for her simply because she said the truth. So Sandman I sent you a donation before and here's my assessment of you: Firstly you are someone who openly wants to use a woman to get a child through surrogacy and has a lot of female clients is struggling with the concept of using women. Second, you did read my entire comment, but had trouble making sense of it and that shows. Thirdly, you were stating at one point that a woman was in love!!! Face palm. I'm a woman and I'm just saying. Good grief, I made that donation in attempt to find more way\u2019s to be useful. I\u2019m pretty good at the old fashioned ways, they just seem to be a bit lacking. I had hoped you would humor me and make a few suggestions or just bluntly tell me women can\u2019t be useful to men. In the worst case I thought you would have just made fun of me. The idea of you mistaking my gender for a dude seems laughably small at the time. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so funny anymore. At this point saying that you need to be mindful is pretty much all I can do. Hopefully the next time someone sends you a sappy story (even if it is true) without clarifying their gender, you will remember these statements. Apart from my ranting, the video was well made and it had some interesting insights and points I had not realized. My partner now has an IT job he enjoys and I\u2019m still working part time and going to school for a degree in business economics at my own pace. I seemed to have dragged him from blue pill all the way to purple for reasons I can't even comprehend. My partner and I are looking in to it. One thing is for sure if there\u2019s nothing to gain for him, he won\u2019t stay. If that happens, well that\u2019s my problem. In any case thank you for regarding me kindly and tolerating me as much as you have. PS don\u2019t beat yourself up about not noticing. No one in the comments has figured it out yet and no one has bothered to ask. In that regard I should have known this would happen. Anyway I got what I came for even before I made the donations. I am female stupidity at its finest. Sincerely, Fat cat\" Well Fat Cat thanks for the donation as well as potentially tricking me into thinking you were a male. 9 pictures paid for and licensed through BigStock.com (In order of appearance) 1.

{"sentence": "Annual West point Pillow Fight Gone Wild - Fight, Weapons, Blood - 4 September 2015 At West Point, Annual Pillow Fight Becomes Weaponized For generations, freshmen cadets at the United States Military Academy have marked the end of a grueling summer of training with a huge nighttime pillow fight that is billed as a harmless way to blow off steam and build class spirit. But this year the fight on the West Point, N.Y., campus turned bloody as some cadets swung pillowcases packed with hard objects, thought to be helmets, that split lips, broke at least one bone, dislocated shoulders and knocked cadets unconscious. The brawl at the publicly funded academy, where many of the Army\u2019s top leaders are trained, left 30 cadets injured, including 24 with concussions, according to West Point. In interviews, cadets who asked that their names not be used for fear of repercussions in West Point\u2019s strictly controlled culture, said the fight had left one cadet with a broken leg and dislocated shoulders in others. One cadet was knocked unconscious and taken away in an ambulance and had not returned to school, they said. But a spokesman for the academy, Lt. Col. Christopher Kasker, said all cadets had returned to duty. Though talk about the brawl on Aug. 20 had circulated on social media, West Point did not confirm it to The New York Times until Thursday. Colonel Kasker said the annual fight is organized by first-year students as a way to build camaraderie after the summer program that prepares them for the rigors of plebe year. Upperclassmen overseeing freshmen \u201callowed the spirit activity to occur out of the desire to enhance the spirit of the class,\u201d Colonel Kasker said, adding that those upperclassmen took \u201cmitigating measures\u201d to prevent injury, including requiring cadets to wear helmets. But video shows that many of the cadets did not wear helmets. Cadets said that in at least a few cases helmets became weapons stuffed into pillowcases. \u201cWest Point applauds the cadets\u2019 desire to build esprit and regrets the injuries to our cadets,\u201d Colonel Kasker said. \u201cWe are conducting appropriate investigations into the causes of the injuries.\u201d So far no cadets have been punished, and the academy has no plans to end the annual tradition. Colonel Kasker said commanders were not available for comment on Friday. Video of the fight posted online showed crowds of cadets, some wearing body armor as well as helmets, surging together in a central quad, their yells echoing off the stone walls of the surrounding barracks. As the first-year cadets collided into a boil of white pillows, pummeling one another in the fading light, Army-issued glow sticks flew through the air and an impromptu cavalry of riders in laundry carts dashed in, cushions swinging. At one point, a smoke grenade appeared to go off. Photos posted later on Twitter show plebes, as freshmen are called, with bloody faces and bloody pillows, and at least one person being loaded into an ambulance. \u201cMy plebe was knocked unconscious and immediately began fighting when he came to,\u201d an unnamed upperclassman, who was apparently observing from the sidelines, wrote on the social media forum Yik Yak. \u201cI was so proud I could cry.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story As the battle continued, cadets clustered around at least two classmates who had fallen, apparently unable to get up. Others stumbled to a medical area set up beside the fracas. \u201c4 concussions, 1 broken leg, 2 broken arms, 1 dislocated shoulder, and several broken ribs. That\u2019s one hell of a pillow fight. #USMA19,\u201d one freshman posted on Twitter, echoing many who seemed to see the injuries as a point of pride. As the scope of injuries became clear, cadets said in interviews, West Point staff members went door to door in the barracks giving quick concussion checks. In interviews, cadets said they saw the fight as a chance to have fun after seven weeks of basic training in which they were not supposed to speak to one another. It was also a chance to show grit. \u201cIf you don\u2019t come back with a bloody nose,\u201d a male first-year cadet said his upperclassman commander told him, \u201cyou didn\u2019t try hard enough.\u201d", "label": "harmful"}

He didn't give me a topic so I thought I'd read everyone a recent statement by Turd Flinging Monkey where he created a Monkey's Market Minute and lays out the case there as well as a recent video where he calls crypto currency. I want to where I believe he's right and where I believe he's wrong. His post is locked on Patreon so only people that pay for it can actually read it. I hope he doesn't mind I read it as I'm sure he'll enjoy the promotion for this segment and that some of you might go over to Patreon and Subscribestar and sponsor him. Here's what the market minute says after a 3% pullback on the markets on February 26th and I quote: \"Yesterday, bond yields caused all markets to fall as people pulled out of all assets into cash. Even Cryptocurrency, gold, real estate, and bonds were down which shows how irrational it was. You have to put your money somewhere or inflation will eat your lunch, and stocks are the best liquid hedge against inflation. Gold doesn't pay dividends, and real estate income is not reliable due to eviction moratoriums and low interest rates (causing good renters to buy their own homes). Cryptocurrency, as a sector is horrible, and under performed all other sectors, including gold. Some coins are doing well, but when the stimmy checks end, there won't be any more suckers to buy.\" unquote. I'll get to TFM's comments in just a moment but let me first tell me first tell everyone about today's sponsor Swan Bitcoin: Anyways now back to the clown world. I guess with that ad you might say that I have a bias towards crypto currency. But the answer to that is yes and now. First off I'm in agreement with TFM about inflation. I also agree on the point about Bitcoin It's in a bubble. You're probably wondering how I can promote it and own it if I believe it's in a bubble. I'll get to that in a few moments. TFM is also right that I'm in Crypto because I was paid in basic attention token. That's what first got me into it in 2019 but I converted them all to Bitcoin or cash to pay my taxes. I own Bitcoins and not shitcoins. You can only create digital scarcity once and expect people to adopt it. Bitcoin is a one time thing. Other coins that are ICOs are fraudulent shitcoins that were created out of thin air like fiat and the people that created them are just as bad as the money printers. Where I believe TFM gets things wrong is when he's underestimating the effects of real estate which makes stocks a poor hedge against inflation unless they are high growth tech stocks in companies that are monopolies. Amazon, Google, etc. Also he's right that on the 26th of February cryptocurrency under performed all other other sectors, including gold. But for the last ten years it's outperformed all other sectors combined. You're cherry picking TFM instead of zooming out. I wasn't going to say anything but I want to clarify why crypto has room in a balanced portfolio. Not your entire portfolio but a portion of it. You also say that once the stimulus checks end there won't be anymore suckers to buy. Actually the retail investors don't really drive crypto as much anymore. It's the hedge funds, as well as companies like Tesla, Twitter, Micro-strategy as well insurance companies like Boston Mass Mutual, The Guggenheim Fund, Black rock, Paypal and even schools like Yale, Harvard, Brown. Why are all those people buying crypto which you described as a great big beany baby in your Monkeynomics 101 video?

We have very sad news about 55 year old actress Julia Roberts, she has been confirmed as.. #juliaroberts Julia Fiona Roberts (born October 28, 1967)[1] is an American actress. Known for her leading roles in films encompassing a variety of genres, she has received multiple accolades, including an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, and three Golden Globe Awards. The films in which she has starred have collectively grossed over $3.9 billion globally, making her one of Hollywood's most bankable stars.[2] After an early breakthrough with appearances in Mystic Pizza (1988) and Steel Magnolias (1989), Roberts established herself as a leading actress when she headlined the romantic comedy Pretty Woman (1990), which grossed $464 million worldwide. She starred in numerous commercially successful films throughout the 1990s, including the cult romantic comedies My Best Friend's Wedding (1997), Notting Hill (1999) and Runaway Bride (1999), before winning the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the biographical drama Erin Brockovich (2000). Roberts achieved further film success in the following decades with Ocean's Eleven (2001), Ocean's Twelve (2004), Charlie Wilson's War (2007), Valentine's Day (2010), Eat Pray Love (2010), August: Osage County (2013), Wonder (2017), and Ticket to Paradise (2022). She also received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for the HBO television film The Normal Heart (2014), had her first regular television role in the first season of the Amazon Prime Video psychological thriller series Homecoming (2018), and portrayed Martha Mitchell in the Starz political limited series Gaslit (2022). In addition to acting, Roberts runs the production company Red Om Films, through which she has served as an executive producer for various projects she has starred in, as well as for the first four films of the American Girl franchise (2004\u20132008). She has acted as the global ambassador for Lanc\u00f4me since 2009. She was the world's highest-paid actress throughout the majority of the 1990s and the first half of the 2000s.[3][4][5] She was paid $300,000 for Pretty Woman (1990),[6] and received then-unprecedented fees of $20 million and $25 million for her roles in Erin Brockovich (2000) and Mona Lisa Smile (2003), respectively. As of 2020, Roberts' net worth was estimated to be $250 million.[7] People magazine has named her the most beautiful woman in the world a record five times. Roberts was born on October 28, 1967, in Smyrna, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta,[9] to Betty Lou Bredemus and Walter Grady Roberts.[9][10] She is of English, Scottish, Irish, Welsh, German, and Swedish descent.[11][12] Her father was a Baptist, her mother a Catholic,[13] and she was raised Catholic.[14][15] Her older brother Eric Roberts (born 1956), from whom she was estranged for several years until 2004, older sister Lisa Roberts Gillan (born 1965), and niece Emma Roberts, are also actors. She also had a younger half-sister named Nancy Motes. Roberts's parents, one-time actors and playwrights, met while performing in theatrical productions for the armed forces. They later co-founded the Atlanta Actors and Writers Workshop[16] in Atlanta, off Juniper Street in Midtown. They ran a children's acting school in Decatur, Georgia, while they were expecting Julia. The children of Coretta and Martin Luther King Jr. attended the school; Walter Roberts served as acting coach for their daughter, Yolanda.[17] As a thank-you for his service running the only racially integrated theater troupe in the region and due to the Roberts' financial difficulties,[18] Mrs. King paid Mrs. Roberts's hospital bill when Julia was born.[19][20] Her parents married in 1955. Her mother filed for divorce in 1971; the divorce was finalized in early 1972.[21] From 1972, Roberts lived in Smyrna, Georgia, where she attended Fitzhugh Lee Elementary School, Griffin Middle School, and Campbell High School.[22] In 1972, her mother married Michael Motes, who was abusive and often unemployed; Roberts despised him.[23] The couple had a daughter, Nancy, who died at 37 on February 9, 2014, of an apparent drug overdose.[24] The marriage ended in 1983, with Betty Lou divorcing Motes on cruelty grounds; she had stated that marrying him was the biggest mistake of her life.[23] Roberts's own father died of cancer when she was ten.[25] Roberts wanted to be a veterinarian as a child.[26] She played the clarinet in her school band.[27][28] After graduating from Smyrna's Campbell High School, she attended Georgia State University but did not graduate. She later headed to New York City to pursue a career in acting. Once there, she signed with the Click Modeling Agency and enrolled in acting classes.", "label": "harmful"}

Those who seek validation and attention from multiple people, often exhibit behaviors such as leaving messages unread and only wanting to engage with someone when they feel like it. It's important to recognize these negative signals and eliminate them quickly to avoid wasting time and growing resentful. Additionally, it's important to not let insults or negative comments from attention wh*res affect one's self-esteem.

It\u2019s Bourbon Street, it\u2019s downtown Nashville, it\u2019s the strips of bars in Austin, Texas. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are some great parts to those cities, but a bar on Friday night, the strip on Saturday night, you best believe there will men transforming to white knights come 1 a.m. all to prove their worth in the ring for the king, or in this case, the queen. Men, right here, you\u2019re just a pawn. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m focusing on today. I\u2019m focusing on this and this segment of female nature, as it can save some of you from the pitfalls of dating, from being clouded in love when in actuality it\u2019s just a business agreement, and also, thirdly for my own therapy as I\u2019ve been through this and I know that some of you have been through this. So, to get a modern day look at this, let\u2019s delve into an email that I got from a viewer recently! And by the way, to the bro that sent me this story, just letting you know that I added some transitions and cleaned up the email a little bit to let the narrative flow a little better as it\u2019s not exactly word for word what you sent me. \u201cShe almost had her boyfriend beat me up and I did not know or talk to the girl!\u201d Hey hoodie, I love your content! I am 24-years old and I work in sales and I see female nature everyday as a door-to-door salesman. I can tell you many stories doing this job for five years, so the story I am going to tell you happened in March. I stop by a local store everyday to buy food and snacks for work. So there is this girl that works there, and I have never hit on her or looked at her in anyway. I just pay for the food and go. Everything is close by so I walk a lot and I always run into the girl that almost had her boyfriend beat me up. I just walk in since I am always on the clock for work, so one day I was walking by and she was at the bus stop with her boyfriend. I was walking by with my headphones in and she was looking at me while I was walking and I heard him yelling and saying something (presumably directed at me). So, a few weeks later I was paying for my food and she was like, \u201cI got a boyfriend, and I am taken.\u201d At this point, I was in shock. I told her that I didn\u2019t even hit on you or look at you, and that\u2019s why she was blushing and turning red. Now, the good part - so this was three weeks ago and I was walking home from a big workout at the gym. Out of nowhere I felt a push, and I thought that someone had tripped me by accident. He (her boyfriend) tried to push me and he said, stop stalking my girl. I was like, what the heck, who is your girl? So, he charged at me and I had him in a hold. I was angry and I eventually let him go and I told him to calm down. He told me the whole story how she was telling him that I was stalking her and I wanted her. Ultimately, she just started drama for nothing a while ago. \ud83c\udf04 You are just a pawn - or a bounty hunter. It\u2019s the \u201cbouncer\u201d effect \ud83c\udf04 One of the most attractive thing to a girl is when you stand up for her against another man And we are not talking about a murderer or an actual threat - just another Joe Shmo most likely. \ud83c\udf04 There is an ill that is driving this - low self-esteem and the aim to attain validation You\u2019re going to be dealing with significant baggage \ud83c\udf04 You cannot please this type of woman ultimately Link to His Facebook Post | https://www.facebook.com/Big-Lots-163403143686725/reviews?__xt__=33.%7B%22logging_data%22%3A%7B%22page_id%22%3A163403143686725%2C%22event_type%22%3A%22clicked_all_page_reviews%22%2C%22impression_info%22%3A%22eyJmIjp7InBhZ2VfaWQiOiIxNjM0MDMxNDM2ODY3MjUiLCJpdGVtX2NvdW50IjoiMCJ9fQ%22%2C%22surface%22%3A%22www_pages_home%22%2C%22interacted_story_type%22%3A%221076727669006899%22%2C%22session_id%22%3A%222eb44a13767427783bc27b21469753bb%22%7D%7D #hoodiesup", "label": "harmful"}

We were engaged for 1 year and bought a house almost a year to the day we broke up. So in my mind I was in it for the long run now but I was certainly wrong on that. We were happy or so I thought. We never really argued or anything of that nature. Like most women she was hungry for control. She had it from day one and often displayed manipulative behaviour and for whatever reason I allowed this to happen, perhaps because I was and still am deeply in love with her. It's funny because in every other case in my life I am very much in control and an alpha male I'm 6 ft 2 220 lbs ex boxer and she's small and fragile yet with her I was always weak and beta and let her basically do what she wants when she wants. I'm well aware this is a recipe for disaster but I let it happen anyway naively thinking that it will make her happy. With regards to social status I have a decent paying job however I have to work 70+ hour weeks (12 hour shifts day + night) to make a good living, whereas she has a higher paying job with a lot less hours (but also 12 hour shifts days + nights). I have worked a lot of overtime from January to now to pay for our Wedding which was booked for next year in a luxury location in spain (We are from the UK). All of which was what she wanted. As a result of this we weren't seeing all that much of each other in the last few months So to get into things, 2 months ago I was at work to which I received a message from her saying that she needs to talk to me later, that's never a good sign but the last thing I was expecting was an abrupt end to our 13 years together. I came home to which she said the dreaded words \"I'm not happy\" I was in total shock and disbelief at what I was hearing, I asked so \"So are you saying you don't want to get married?\" At this point she said that she still wants to marry me however she wants to address her feelings now so it can change by next year (Our wedding date) and her solution was to \"Take it back how it used to be\" by going on dates etc Whilst I was in total shock at this revelation from her as I had NO CLUE she felt this way I thought it would be ok because she wants to work on a solution. However 24 hours later she did a total 180 and said to me that \"It's too late\" and that \"She doesn't love me anymore\" and that \"It's over\". But I am 99% sure that there is someone else involved here. There are A LOT of signs that have been there as early as March this year where I arranged to get security CCTV cameras put on the exterior of my house to which she totally flipped her lid and reacted extremely aggressively and irrationally for me wanting to make my house safer. This is despite the fact that she didn't have to pay a penny toward them it was all being paid for by myself. She was so aggressively against the cameras being put on the house that she tried to deflect her ridiculous behaviour onto me and act like I was in the wrong. To keep the peace I didn't get the cameras so I guess she succeeded in her plan. 8 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com.

Known for his versatility and intense acting style, he has received various accolades, including an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and three British Academy Film Awards. His films have grossed over $11 billion worldwide, making him one of the highest-grossing actors of all time.[1] Oldman began acting in theatre in 1979 and made his film debut in Remembrance (1982). He continued to follow a stage career in London's Royal Court and was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, with credits including Cabaret, Romeo and Juliet, Entertaining Mr Sloane, Saved, The Country Wife and Hamlet. He rose to prominence in British film with his portrayals of Sid Vicious in Sid and Nancy (1986), Joe Orton in Prick Up Your Ears (1987) and Rosencrantz in Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead (1990), while also attracting attention as the leader of a gang of football hooligans in the television film The Firm (1989). Regarded as a member of the \"Brit Pack\",[2] he achieved greater recognition as a New York gangster in State of Grace (1990), Lee Harvey Oswald in JFK (1991) and Count Dracula in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992). Oldman portrayed the villains in films such as True Romance (1993), The Fifth Element (1997), Air Force One (1997) and The Contender (2000); corrupt DEA agent Norman Stansfield, whom he played in L\u00e9on: The Professional (1994), was called one of cinema's best villains. He also played Ludwig van Beethoven in Immortal Beloved (1994) and later appeared in franchise roles such as Sirius Black in the Harry Potter series, James Gordon in The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005\u20132012) and a human leader, Dreyfus in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014). He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour (2017), and was nominated for his portrayals of George Smiley in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011) and Herman J. Mankiewicz in Mank (2020). Oldman was executive producer of films like The Contender, Plunkett & Macleane (1999) and Nil by Mouth (1997), the latter of which he also wrote and directed. He has featured in television shows such as Slow Horses, Fallen Angels, Tracey Takes On... and Friends, voiced Ignitius and Viktor Reznov respectively in The Legend of Spyro and Call of Duty video games, and appeared in music videos for David Bowie, Guns N' Roses and Annie Lennox. Gary Leonard Oldman[3] was born in New Cross, London, on 21 March 1958,[4][5] the son of Leonard Bertram Oldman (1921\u20131985), a former sailor who also worked as a welder, and Kathleen (n\u00e9e Cheriton; 1919\u20132018).[6][7] He said his father was an alcoholic who left the family when Oldman was seven years old.[8] His older sister, Maureen, is an actress better known as Laila Morse; she performed in Oldman's directorial debut Nil by Mouth (1997), before taking on her most famous role of Mo Harris in the BBC soap opera EastEnders.[9] Oldman attended West Greenwich School in Deptford, leaving at the age of 16 to work in a sports shop.[10] He played piano as a child, but he gave up his musical aspirations to pursue an acting career after seeing Malcolm McDowell's performance in the film The Raging Moon (1971).[11][12][13] In a 1995 interview with Charlie Rose, he said, \"Something about Malcolm just arrested me, and I connected, and I said, 'I wanna do that.'\"[11] Growing up in south London, Oldman supported his local football club, Millwall F.C., but also followed Manchester United because he idolised George Best.[9] In 2011, he learned from his mother that his father had played for Millwall just after World War II: \"Just after the war, [my mother] ran a boarding house for football players\u2014Millwall players. And I knew that my dad was involved somehow with the reserve team. But two weeks ago my mum said, 'Oh yeah, your dad played for Millwall. When he was young he had a couple of first team games.'\"[9] Oldman studied with the Young People's Theatre in Greenwich during the mid-1970s,[6][14] while working jobs on assembly lines, as a porter in an operating theatre, selling shoes and beheading pigs in an abattoir.[6] He applied unsuccessfully to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), which welcomed him to try again the following year, but advised him to find something else to do for a living.[6][11] When asked by Charlie Rose if he had reminded RADA of this, Oldman joked that \"the work speaks for itself\".[11] He won a scholarship to attend the Rose Bruford College in Sidcup, south-east London, from which he graduated with a BA in Acting in 1979.[6][14] Oldman described himself as a \"shy\" but diligent worker during his time there, performing roles such as Puck in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.[15]", "label": "harmful"}

Check your privilege at the door Becky. On a serious note, I am making this video as a semi-response to recent vid I made on Decolonizing Fitness. I got a massive amount of hate on that video for speaking my mind. People were calling for me to be canceled because I said that gender reassignment surgery (aka cutting off your body parts and taking sex hormones of your opposite gender) was a bad idea. Most of the comments were along the lines of \"you're racist and transphobic, delete this video or I'm reporting you.\" These people are pathetic leeches on society and it's about time someone stands up to them, as it doesn't seem like anyone is. All they do when someone disagrees with them is cry like little bitches and try to get that person canceled. Not only are they opposed to any sort of discussion, opposing viewpoint, or criticism, but they are violently oppressive in their attempts to silence anyone who doesn't support their narrative. I personally don't give a fuck. I'm going to speak my mind on this subject whether they like it or not. They're obviously incapable of actually arguing their point because they have no logical ground to stand on. THEY are the bullies, THEY are the totalitarians. If they had any sort of logical argument to support their points, they would argue it instead of just pointing their fingers and saying, \"you're racist, you're transphobic!\" I've left the comments section ENABLED on this because I WELCOME discussion on the topic, even if it's 700 people telling me I'm an asshole. I'm not afraid of people disagreeing with what I believe.

{"sentence": "Brian Greene: \"Black Holes Do NOT Exist! James Webb Telescope SHOCKS The Astronomy World!\" The boats of Astronomy are being rocked by the James Webb Space Telescope observations in ways never seen before! No matter how strong its gravitational pull is, not even light can evade a black hole. Extensive research and observations have consistently supported their importance in expanding our knowledge of the universe, since they were initially postulated in the early 20th century by Einstein's theory of general relativity. The James Webb Space Telescope is one of the instruments used by scientists to investigate the realities of space. However, the information it is gathering is completely at odds with what we had anticipated, which is a major concern. A new set of results from the James Webb Space Telescope casts doubt on the reality of black holes and calls into question our long-held assumptions about the universe. Additionally, Brian Greene has just verified the latest results.

Even though they have been studying Saturn since the 17th century, they have barely scratched the surface of this interesting planet. It is the second-largest planet after Jupiter and the sixth planet from the sun. Like its twin, Jupiter, it is called a gas giant because it is composed of hydrogen and helium. Saturn is one-eighth the average density of the Earth, but it is over 95 times larger than the Earth. It has a pale yellow hue due to the presence of ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. It also has a prominent ring system that comprises mainly ice particles with a small amount of rocky debris and dust.

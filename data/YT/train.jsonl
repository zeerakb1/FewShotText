Sarah Jessica Parker returns once again as Carrie Bradshaw, the style-maven journalist whose romantic exploits were the key focus of the show. Also reprising their roles are Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis, and Cynthia Nixon, with the series' executive producer Michael Patrick King taking on writing and directing duties. Several years have passed since viewers last saw Carrie and company, though she's still involved with Mr. Big (Chris Noth) and completely consumed by her obsession for name-brand accessories. Meanwhile, Miranda is adjusting to married life and motherhood, Charlotte is still clinging to her dreams, and Samantha and handsome, steely eyed TV star Smith Jerrod (Jason Lewis) are now living together out in L.A. Of course, when the girls all come together, it's just like old times. Dreamgirls' Jennifer Hudson co-stars as Carrie's assistant.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \u00a9 Warner Bros.

She is married to one of the wealthiest, most successful basketball players and through his influence and resources has accomodated wealth for herself. She has a cooking show, cook books and a makeup endorsement. She has what most women would want. Yet she still desires attention from other men. From watichng your videos, I find this somewhat narcissistic that a wealthy married woman who has \"everything\" the world would have to offer would still desire attention from other men. So when she gets this attention, will she reciprocate or ignore. Will she deny the men giving her attention. No man wants to set himself up for rejection. It seems to me like she wants to be worshiped. What if her husband complained that he wasn't getting sexual attention from women. Hence the double standard.\" Well Seun thanks for the donation and topic request.

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "5 minutes ago / crying all my tears at the last farewell to singer Rod Stewart, goodbye and rest. 5 minutes ago / crying all my tears at the last farewell to singer Rod Stewart, goodbye and rest.\n\n#rodstewart \n\nSir Roderick David Stewart CBE (born 10 January 1945)[1] is a British rock and pop singer and songwriter. Born and raised in London, he is of Scottish and English ancestry. With his distinctive raspy singing voice, Stewart is among the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold over 250 million records worldwide.[2] He has had 10 number-one albums and 31 top ten singles in the UK, six of which reached number one.[3] Stewart has had 16 top ten singles in the US, with four reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100. He was knighted in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to music and charity.[4]\n\nStewart's music career began in 1962 when he took up busking with a harmonica. In 1963, he joined The Dimensions as a harmonica player and vocalist. In 1964, Stewart joined Long John Baldry and the All Stars before moving to the Jeff Beck Group in 1967. Joining Faces in 1969, he also maintained a solo career releasing his debut album that year. Stewart's early albums were a fusion of rock, folk music, soul music, and R&B.[5][6] His third album, 1971's Every Picture Tells a Story, was his breakthrough, topping the charts in the UK, US, Canada and Australia, as did its ballad \"Maggie May\". His 1972 follow-up album, Never a Dull Moment, also reached number one in the UK and Australia, while going top three in the US and Canada. Its single, \"You Wear It Well\", topped the chart in the UK and was a moderate hit elsewhere.\n\nAfter Stewart had a handful more UK top ten hits, the Faces broke up in 1975. Stewart's next few hit singles were ballads with \"Sailing\", off the 1975 UK and Australian number-one album, Atlantic Crossing, becoming a hit in the UK and the Netherlands (number one), Germany (number four) and other countries, but barely charting in North America. A Night on the Town (1976), his fifth straight chart-topper in the UK, began a three-album run of going number one or top three in the US, Canada, the UK and Australia with each release. That album's \"Tonight's the Night (Gonna Be Alright)\" spent almost two months at number one in the US and Canada, and made the top five in other countries. Foot Loose & Fancy Free (1977) contained the hit \"You're in My Heart (The Final Acclaim)\" as well as the rocker \"Hot Legs\". Blondes Have More Fun (1978) and its disco-tinged \"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy\" both went to number one in Canada, Australia and the US, with \"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy\" also hitting number one in the UK and the top ten in other countries. Stewart's albums regularly hit the upper rungs of the charts in the Netherlands throughout the 70s and in Sweden from 1975 onward.\n\nAfter a disco and new wave period in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Stewart's music turned to a soft rock/middle-of-the-road style, with most of his albums reaching the top ten in the UK, Germany and Sweden, but faring less well in the US. The single \"Rhythm of My Heart\" was a top five hit in the UK, US and other countries, with its source album, 1991's Vagabond Heart, becoming, at number ten in the US and number two in the UK, his highest-charting album in a decade. In 1993, he collaborated with Bryan Adams and Sting on the power ballad \"All for Love\", which went to number one in many countries. In the early 2000s, he released a series of successful albums interpreting the Great American Songbook.\n\nIn 2008, Billboard magazine ranked him the 17th most successful artist on the \"Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists\".[7] A Grammy and Brit Award recipient, he was voted at No. 33 in Q Magazine's list of the Top 100 Greatest Singers of all time[8] As a solo artist, Stewart was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, and he was inducted a second time into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 as a member of Faces.\n\nRoderick David Stewart was born at 507 Archway Road, Highgate, North London, on 10 January 1945, the youngest of five children of Robert Joseph Stewart (26 December 1904[11]\u20131990)[12] and Elsie Rebecca Gilbart (14 December 1905[11]\u20131996).[13][14] His father was Scottish and had been a master builder in Leith, Edinburgh, while Elsie was English and had grown up in Upper Holloway in North London. Married in 1928, the couple had two sons and two daughters while living in Scotland, and then they moved to Highgate.\n\nStewart was born at home during World War II, eight years after his nearest sibling.[13][15][nb 1] The family was neither affluent nor poor; Stewart was spoiled as the youngest, and has called his childhood \"fantastically happy\".[13][15] He had an undistinguished record at Highgate Primary School and failed the eleven plus exam.[19] He then attended the William Grimshaw Secondary Modern School (later Fortismere School), Muswell Hill."}

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "American fans burst into tears after hearing the sad news about the legendary Arnold Schwarzenegger. American fans burst into tears after hearing the sad news about the legendary Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\n#arnoldschwarzenegger \n\nArnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born in Thal on July 30, 1947,[15] the second son of Gustav Schwarzenegger and his wife, Aurelia (n\u00e9e Jadrny). Schwarzenegger's father was the local chief of police. After the Anschluss in 1938, he joined the Nazi Party and, in 1939 the Sturmabteilung (SA). In World War II, he served as a military policeman in the invasions of Poland, France and the Soviet Union, including the siege of Leningrad, rising to the rank of Hauptfeldwebel.[16][17] He was wounded in the Battle of Stalingrad,[18] and was discharged in 1943 following a bout of malaria. According to Holocaust scholar Michael Berenbaum, Gustav Schwarzenegger served \"in theaters of the war where atrocities were committed. But there is no way to know from the documents whether he played a role.\"[16] Gustav's background received wide press attention during the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election in which Schwarzenegger was elected governor.[19]\n\nGustav Schwarzenegger married Aurelia on October 20, 1945; he was 38 and she was 23. According to Schwarzenegger, his parents were very strict: \"Back then in Austria it was a very different world [...] if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents, the rod was not spared.\"[20] He grew up in a Catholic family.[21] Gustav preferred his elder son, Meinhard, over Arnold.[22] His favoritism was \"strong and blatant\", which stemmed from unfounded suspicion that Arnold was not his biological child.[23] Schwarzenegger has said that his father had \"no patience for listening or understanding your problems\".[21] He had a good relationship with his mother, with whom he kept in touch until her death.\n\nSchwarzenegger is considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding,[8] and his legacy is commemorated in the Arnold Classic annual bodybuilding competition. He has remained a prominent face in bodybuilding long after his retirement, in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows.\n\nFor many years, he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines Muscle & Fitness and Flex. Shortly after being elected governor, he was appointed the executive editor of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 a year to the Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. When the deal, including the contract that gave Schwarzenegger at least $1 million a year, was made public in 2005, many criticized it as being a conflict of interest since the governor's office made decisions concerning regulation of dietary supplements in California.[47] Consequently, Schwarzenegger relinquished the executive editor role in 2005.[47] American Media Inc., which owns Muscle & Fitness and Flex, announced in March 2013 that Schwarzenegger had accepted their renewed offer to be executive editor of the magazines.[47]\n\nOne of the first competitions he won was the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965.[15] He won Mr. Europe the following year, at age 19.[15][27] He would go on to compete in many bodybuilding contests, and win most of them. His bodybuilding victories included five Mr. Universe wins (4 \u2013 NABBA [England], 1 \u2013 IFBB [USA]), and seven Mr. Olympia wins, a record which would stand until Lee Haney won his eighth consecutive Mr. Olympia title in 1991.\n\nSchwarzenegger continues to work out. When asked about his personal training during the 2011 Arnold Classic he said that he was still working out a half an hour with weights every day.\n\nIn an interview with Fortune in 2004, Schwarzenegger told how he suffered what \"would now be called child abuse\" at the hands of his father: \"My hair was pulled. I was hit with belts. So was the kid next door. It was just the way it was. Many of the children I've seen were broken by their parents, which was the German-Austrian mentality. They didn't want to create an individual. It was all about conforming. I was one who did not conform, and whose will could not be broken. Therefore, I became a rebel. Every time I got hit, and every time someone said, 'You can't do this,' I said, 'This is not going to be for much longer because I'm going to move out of here. I want to be rich. I want to be somebody.'\"[17]\n\nSchwarzenegger served in the Austrian Army in 1965 to fulfill the one year of service required at the time of all 18-year-old Austrian males.[15][27] During his army service, he won the Junior Mr. Europe contest.[26] He went AWOL during basic training so he could take part in the competition and then spent a week in military prison: \"Participating in the competition meant so much to me that I didn't carefully think through the consequences.\""}

There are many ways to go about this because it depends on where you are in life. \n\nIf you're a young person, focus on building your skills. Find a skill you can be good at and be exceptional at it. Become so exceptional that people know you because you're good at it. There's something in your life that you're obsessed about than anyone else, get good at that. Practice more than anyone else, pay more attention to subtle details and by the laws of human nature, you're just gonna get good and excel. Be the best and women will say and think you're going somewhere.\n\nIf you're an adult though, the way to do it is to understand that people gravitate towards value. If you're an adult and you want to be surrounded by women, have an open relationship. This may not be for some of you guys but this is my recipe, it's all about polyamory. Offer polyamory. Don't be scared to offer this to women because women are more prone or up to it than you can ever imagine. The key though is to remain masculine around your woman. Don't goof around her and don't react to her. You want to be known as someone who's serious but jokes around from time to time.\n\nHere's a link to the article version: https://mindfulattraction.org/blog/2019/8/18/how-to-create-a-life-surrounded-by-women\n\nCheck out my course Dark Game so you\u2019ll learn all the techniques needed for you to attract women. https://dalexis-school.thinkific.com/courses/dark-game"}

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "The end of the World, my broken heart stops, then goes on beating How much more time do I have? Please scroll down and read the discription below!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_cJBpbm2fHo45BynoyRSXA?feature=watch\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/helpforyourday/\nhttp://sanctification.podbean.com/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-sLjpZYal3Y6Wso5qwaxhw/featured\nTHE AUDIO VOICE ( Master of Ceremony) on this video belongs to the professional speaker from the United Kingdom by the name of Gary Spicer, lets all give Gary a big hand for the time and dedication and labor of love He has put into this audio!!! Gary's contact information are the two links above.\n  The exact time and date our heart will stop beating is recorded! Our Lord knows exactly the length of time we have left, our remaining time is measured; for some it may be just hours; others a day, a week, a month or more. Whatever the time, our death is scheduled, and no man can escape, as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment (Hebrews 9:27).\n   Our eyes have been opened to the reality that soon our time could run out. We are allotted such a short time on earth; how can anyone afford to give the devil even one minute of that precious time? Few people live to see seventy years, much less eighty; and many, many today have already lived longer than half their lifetimes. But we have a Rapture to look forward to; that time is very near at hand. Today, many of those living in God's will shall meet the Rapture in the air.\n  We know the season of the Rapture, but not the exact time. Jesus said we would not walk in the night, that when we saw the end-time signs come to pass we should lift up our heads, our redemption draweth nigh. All around us we see the end-time signs which have been prophesied. Ezekiel, twenty-five hundred years ago, told what would be happening in our day; and those things are taking place now. How wonderful to live in such a day!\n    The Bible tells us that it is appointed unto everyone to die. Paul, when his appointed time drew near, was secure. He wrote Timothy, saying: For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, and I have kept the faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, (II Timothy 4:6-8). Are we living for our Lord; do we have the same Holy Spirit in our life as Paul had?\n   When God comes to our last moment of time, will we scream, I don't want to go! Wait a little longer? Will we plead for more time to make things right in our life? It will be too late. So many times in the past we have won\u00addered when our time would come; but now it's here and we're not ready. It can't be time already, we cry. I'm still young! I have years ahead of me! But you have no years, no weeks, not even hours or minutes. Your time is up. How tragic.\n   The Lord is crying to every one of us to set our house in order; we're going to die some day. The cemeteries remind us that everyone dies sooner or later. Aren't those tombstones testimony that you, too, will die? The doctor can do his best for you, but when the time comes, you must keep it, there is no way out.\n    We stand at a crucial time! Is sin of any kind in our heart? If so, what if we seal our destiny that way? For some, whatever we decide now will be final. Set thine house in order, for thou shalt die and not live. Either heaven or hell, our time is set and sealed. As it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment. Are we ready for it?\n   If you will, please say this prayer with me. Dear God I am very sorry that I have sinned against you. I ask you dear God to forgive me of all my sins.Wash away all of my sins with the blood of Jesus, come into my heart and life dear Jesus! I accept you as my Lord and Savior. I will serve you Lord Jesus with all of my heart, forever...thank you Lord Jesus for coming into my life!"}

Next we attempt a meltshot off the puck  with the new camera and it is very low temp so there is not much action except a beautiful clear puddle! So we fire up the cheech glass with a double banger and go in for real! The ending got cut off but you already know!

Depression is widespread but poorly understood. This video provides an overview of what depression actually is including a discussion of symptoms, causes, and treatment.\n\nAt its worst, depression can be a frightening, debilitating condition. Millions of people around the world live with depression. Many of these individuals and their families are afraid to talk about their struggles and don't know where to turn for help. However, depression is largely preventable and treatable. Recognizing depression and seeking help is the first and most critical toward recovery. \n\n#MentalHealth #Depression #MentalHealthAwareness\n\nDr Varudhini Kankipati, PhD is a practising psychologist who specializes in individual, family and group psychotherapy, working with children, adolescents, and adults.

The kinds of planetary settings to take into account are fast changing, ranging from \"super-Earths\" that are roughly the size of Earth and Uranus to \"hot Jupiters\" that circle near to suns and a variety of other planetary sizes.

This may sound like a bunch of random letters mixed together, but in reality it is the name of one of the most fascinating planets astronomers have ever discovered. Nick-named the \u201cSuper-Saturn\u201d, this bizarre planet has 37 rings surrounding it that span an astonishing 30 million miles across. In fact, the ring system is so massive and dense that if the planet orbited around the sun, the rings would be visible right here on Earth at night.\n\nIts estimated that the \u201cSuper-Saturn\u201d is a gas giant, similar but much bigger than the gas giants in our own solar system. That means if you were to try to land on it you would actually fall straight through into its core where the pressure is great enough to squish you into the size of a peanut.\n\nThis planet is definitely special enough to be #1 on our list, but what other strange planets have scientists discovered in the universe?

So many of your videos seem to get into female nature and *why* one should go MGTOW, but not *how*. I wish there were more material on what MGTOWs should do to sustain themselves physically, emotionally, and spiritually in the absence of romantic love, sex, and companionship/partnership. I've brainstormed myself a bit and have come up with meditation and/or prayer for the spiritual and emotional self-care. Massage (which is easy to afford when you're not blowing money on dates), moderate exercise, and good diet for physical self-care. Social time with family and/or platonic friends for the social aspect of emotional self-care. I personally also choose not to indulge in porn because of the addictive / depravity-spiralling aspect of it and instead prefer using my own imagination when doing my \"bedroom wrist exercises\". I can't prove it scientifically, but I feel like pornography leaves a person more likely to feel even lonelier if over-indulged. However, if and when lover robot rental showrooms go mainstream, I'd love to add that to my self-care regimen. I want to also emphasize that many MGTOW men will need a paradigm shift in their approach to exercise and diet to move away from a female-pleasing aesthetic focus towards a self-care emphasis on health, energy, emotional well-being, and cognitive acuity. I know I've droned on here at length, so now I want to ask both what you think of my own brainstorms on this topic AND if you have more to add on it?

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "Picky Men - MGTOW Picky Men - MGTOW\n\n\nMGTOW Mystery Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0yShJVOSjk\n\n\nHi Everyone Sandman Here,\n\nThis video is brought to you by a donation from Patrick and here's what he has to say: \"Hello Sandman, My name is Patrick. I\u2019m a bilingual French Canadian in my twenties who lives in Gatineau and works in Ottawa in a government office as a computer technician. Long story short, I want to get married one day, but because of your videos, I learned a lot from female nature and learned how na\u00efve I was. I think you saved my life. But I still want to get married, but I\u2019m scared of getting divorced thanks to my new knowledge. So, I wrote a list of requirements of the type of woman I would want to date for my own protection. I printed the list in both French and English. Each time I go out, I bring the list with me. If a woman is interested in me or If I\u2019m interested in a woman, I will show her my list and tell her that this is what I\u2019m looking for in my partner. So far all of them failed. Especially #1 and even Christian girl failed. And each of them are shocked that a man have a list of requirement. I want the honest opinion of a MGTOW about my list of requirements in a woman. I give you permission you show everyone the scanned pictures of my list. You can share my 1st name but not my last name.\" Well Patrick thanks for the donation and topic. I think I'm going to have some really good advice for you. When I was still thinking of getting married and in the bartering stage of MGTOW I thought about going to Quebec because I know that in Quebec you can live with a woman in a common law relationship and you will not be on the hook for alimony and the courts will never come after you for anything more than child support. So I briefly thought about moving to Gatineau and working in Ottawa, the same thing as you because the houses are so much cheaper and in Gatineau I can rely on those Quebec Napoleonic legal codes to protect me. If you must live with a woman don't marry her in Quebec and you won't get taken to the cleaners, ever! You will have the upper hand on the woman you're with in that case. As for your list which I'm sharing here with everyone I must say you're quite the picky dude. When you whip out this list at a date it's going to obviously scare most women away. They will think to themselves, I'm the woman, I'm the one that's supposed to be picky, not the man that I'm with. Number one, never drinking alcohol is tough. I might have a glass of wine even though my naturopath tells me not to because of my gut microbiome. I can understand the second and third points where you don't want the woman to smoke or take drugs. That's a normal request. The idea that she needs a college or university education is the opposite of me. I always had the best of luck dating women without a university education because I find that most women I meet are overly educated for their intelligence level and this creates bitterness and resentment in them. Number five you say that they need to be patient with a man with a speech disorder. I'm going to guess that you have a speech disorder so that's why you put that in there. That's a big deal breaker for a woman. Number six is to love you for your beauty and personality instead of your resources and utility value. You are talking about a woman here and not a man right? Because that's like a woman telling a man I want you to be attracted to me and not my face and boobs. That's simply not going to happen now is it? Don't you see how ridiculous that point is?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com. All image licenses are available upon request."}

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "Letter to label-imposing feminists Yes, the video says \"Dear Feminists.\"\nThe title tells you which ones.\nIf you're one of the rare few who has the decency to accept others' choice to reject feminist ideology, this video is not about you. \n\nFor the rest of you, I wanted to make this as plain and easily understood as possible, such as to require a sheer force of will to fail to grasp what it's about. To do that, I've put it crisp, clean black and white... and here it is again:\n\nDear feminists,\nBecause I advocate for equal legal rights, you say I'm a feminist based on a dictionary definition that uses the word equality. However, based on its history, I say feminism fails to live up to that description. \nFor example, U.S. feminists lobbied to replace existing gender neutral family violence law with a gender discriminatory version. In 1978, feminists described family violence to congress as a male perpetrated, female suffered behavior. \n\"As Susan Brownmiller wrote in her book, Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape, \u201cAs the first permanent acquisition of man, his first piece of real property, woman was, in fact, the original building block, the cornerstone of the \u2018House of the Father.\u2019 Man\u2019s forcible extension of his boundaries to his mate and later to their offspring was the beginning of his concept of ownership.\u201d\nIn fact, studies have shown that wife abuse has its roots in the very structure of society and the family where the husband is expected to play the role of leader. If this position is threatened, many men fall back on their ultimate resource of physical force.\nThe widespread existence of wife beating today underscores the fact that these societal expectations are still prevalent.\"\n\u2013 page 60, hearings before the House of Representatives subcommittee on select education, 95th congress, 2nd session, on HR 7927 & 8948\nThey went on to petition congress to reserve victim's services and funding for only female victims and their children.\nTo that end, they lied about the prevalence of male victims and female perpetrators, including lying about Erin Pizzey's work. \nThey used statistics garnered from research that used creative framing to avoid evidence of male victims and female perpetrators. \nFeminist researchers define the same actions taken for the same reasons differently depending on whether a man or woman did them. \nA man who hit because he felt disrespected was a coercive and controlling abuser. \nA woman who hit because she felt disrespected was a victim engaging in preemptive self-defense. \nWhen researcher Murray Straus described this and other issues with feminist research on partner violence, feminists attacked both his work and his reputation, while using the same slippery framing as their argument against taking his findings into consideration.\nThe Family Violence Prevention and Services Act of 1984 established and funded victim's programs and shelters. \nThis first non-discriminatory law was not what feminists wanted.\nThey continued lobbying for gendered family violence law until they got it in the 1994 Violence Against Women act, which reserved victim's services and shelters for women and their young children. \nThe law also created training for law enforcement, prosecutors, and court personnel to treat family violence as a male crime against female victims, \nand funding for research on the now female-only shelters which would by design avoid finding evidence of male victims and female perpetrators to build a body of false \"evidence\" supporting keeping its application gendered.\nIn other words, feminists deliberately and successfully lobbied to marginalize male victims of female violence.\nWhat part of that do you think constitutes equality?\nI am not a feminist, because I oppose law and policy which discriminate against men on women's behalf.\nWhy don't you?\n_________________________________________________________\n\nFurther reading:\n\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20170206171755/http://www.erinpizzey.com/books.html\n\nhttps://archive.ph/wi8K4\n\nhttp://breakingthescience.org/RichardGelles_MissingPersonsOfDV.php\n\nhttps://mensrightsreview.com/category/political-correctness/\n\nhttp://www.avoiceformen.com/feminism/how-feminists-corrupt-dv-research/\n\nhttp://menaregood.com/wordpress/straus-exposes-the-academic-veils-placed-on-domestic-violence-research/\n\nhttp://www.avoiceformen.com/feminism/feminist-lies-feminism/more-equal-than-others-bias-in-intimate-partner-and-sexual-violence-victims-advocacy/\n\nhttp://www.avoiceformen.com/feminism/feminist-corruption/the-feminist-advocacy-research-scam/\n\nhttp://breakingtheglasses.blogspot.com/2013/01/vawa-is-not-like-that.html"}

His father later became the landlord of two Cheshire pubs: the Ring o' Bells in Frodsham and the Boot Inn in Tarporley. Craig has an older sister named Lea (born 1965). He is of French and Welsh descent, counting the French Huguenot minister Daniel Chamier and Sir William Burnaby, 1st Baronet among his ancestors. His middle name, Wroughton, comes from his great-great-grandmother, Grace Matilda Wroughton.\n\nAfter training at the National Youth Theatre in London and graduating from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in 1991, Craig began his career on stage. He made his film debut in the drama The Power of One (1992) and the family film A Kid in King Arthur's Court (1995), with his breakthrough role coming in the drama serial Our Friends in the North (1996). He gained prominence for his supporting roles in films such as Elizabeth (1998), Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), Road to Perdition (2002), Layer Cake (2004), and Munich (2005).\n\nIn 2006 he took on the role of James Bond in Casino Royale, a reboot of the Bond franchise which was favourably received by critics and earned Craig a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. His non-Bond appearances since then include roles in fantasy film The Golden Compass (2007), the drama Defiance (2008), the science fiction Western Cowboys & Aliens (2011), the mystery thriller The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011), the heist film Logan Lucky (2017), and the mystery comedy Knives Out (2019), the later earning him a Golden Globe Award nomination.\n\nIn 2011 he made his Broadway debut in the revival of Harold Pinter's Betrayal opposite his wife, actress Rachel Weisz. In 2016 he starred in the New York Theatre Workshop production of Othello. In 2022 he returned to Broadway in the title role of Macbeth with Ruth Negga.\n\nIn 1992, Craig married actress Fiona Loudon; they had a daughter named Ella before divorcing in 1994. He later began a relationship with German actress Heike Makatsch, which lasted for seven years before ending in 2004. He subsequently dated and was engaged to film producer Satsuki Mitchell from 2005 until 2010.\n\nCraig and actress Rachel Weisz had known each other since working together on Les Grandes Horizontales (1994). They began dating in December 2010, and were married in a private ceremony in New York City on 22 June 2011 with only four guests in attendance, including Craig's daughter and Weisz's son. It was reported on 1 September 2018 that their first child together, a daughter, had been born."}

It's excruciating to watch, and it's a relief when Maya decides to disappoint the young lad, despite her hurt feelings. But just when all feels fine, something far worse happens, and Jana and Maya become the problem.\n\nA more exuberant classmate, Elena (Marija Jancevska), gets drunk and gets together with Maya's crush. Jana, who believes this guy has just taken her friend's virginity, encourages Maya to take revenge by posting a video of Elena in a compromising situation. Elena is then slut-shamed. Sisterhood deals with the fallout, which includes a police investigation.\n\nSisterhood shows how friendships can turn sour quickly and how teenagers can turn against one another. The fluctuating nature of water is a motif throughout, with several critical scenes taking place either at the swimming pool or on the riverbanks...\n\nOfficial submission of North Macedonia for the 'Best International Feature Film' category of the 94th Academy Awards in 2022."}

{"label": "harmless", "sentence": "Thin Waist Workout At Home #thinwaist #loseweightfast #thinbody #thinbelly #thinbodyworkout It is no wonder that people are looking for ways of keeping their health status. As such people have come up with various ways in which they can do so. Most experts believe that exercise has multiple benefits and the key thing is to ensure that it remains a part of daily activities for a long. A good example is walking or running, both of which help improve and maintain one\u2019s health. Exercise makes one healthy because it develops a strong body. The same can be said of other physical activities such as swimming. Physical activity helps develop muscles and joints as well as other bodily organs especially when one spends much time on the move. Another benefit of exercising is that it improves one\u2019s immunity system. People who take regular exercise can improve their resistance to infection. Regular exercise also aids in decreasing stress levels. People need to maintain good blood pressure, weight, and cholesterol levels to prevent cardiovascular diseases.\n\nExercise, just like foodstuff, requires proper preparation before consumption. One should not starve while taking exercise in order to reap the maximum benefits. All fruits and vegetables are important during one-week workouts in terms of building muscle mass. These are just some of the exercises that can be performed by one. Other examples include squats, crunches, cycling, and running. Many people feel guilty about not performing regular exercises but they have no reason to think differently; they deserve extra credit for doing regular exercise. In fact, many activities that people use for leisure such as watching movies, playing games, socializing, going to beaches, and relaxing. They should take regular breaks from these and instead work on themselves. However, according to most experts, the main thing to remember when working out is not to stop before you reach your peak fitness level. You may also notice side effects like headaches, high blood pressure, and diabetes among others which could arise if the exercise continues beyond the initial period of time. Therefore, it is always advisable to consult your doctor first and after proper medical supervision, restart the exercise. Similarly, it is best to perform all workouts under strict health monitoring in order to avoid injury and unwanted side effects that could lead to permanent problems such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.\n                              Good Luck"}

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "New World Order - Undeniable and Verifiable New World Order: Undeniable and Verifiable\n\nAll of these important people are willing to talk openly about the 'New World Order' , so how is it that so many people still scoff at such a notion?\n\nAs a conspiracy theory, the term New World Order or NWO refers to the emergence of a totalitarian world government.\n\nThe common theme in conspiracy theories about a New World Order is that a secretive power elite with a globalist agenda is conspiring to eventually rule the world through an authoritarian world government\u2014which will replace sovereign nation-states\u2014and an all-encompassing propaganda whose ideology hails the establishment of the New World Order as the culmination of history's progress. Many influential historical and present figures have been purported to be part of a cabal that operates through many front organizations to orchestrate significant political and financial occurrences as well as significant world events as steps in an ongoing plot to achieve world domination through secret political gatherings and decision-making processes.\n\nBefore the early 1990s, New World Order conspiracism was limited to two American countercultures, primarily the militantly anti-government right and secondarily that part of fundamentalist Christianity concerned with the end-time emergence of the Antichrist. Skeptics such as Michael Barkun and Chip Berlet observed that right-wing populist conspiracy theories about a New World Order had not only been embraced by many seekers of stigmatized knowledge but had seeped into popular culture, thereby inaugurating a period during the late 20th and early 21st centuries in the United States, even up to today in 2016, where people were actively preparing for apocalyptic scenarios. Those political scientists were concerned that mass hysteria could have what they judged to be devastating effects on American political life, ranging from widespread political alienation to escalating lone-wolf terrorism.\n\nThe threat of the New World Order hasn't gone anywhere.  Indeed, the pieces are still being put in place today.\n\nSubscribe to this channel - http://www.youtube.com/c/ProperGander\nNew World Order wiki - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_Order_%28conspiracy_theory%29\nNew World Order definition - http://www.threeworldwars.com/new-world-order.htm\nNew World Order: Educate yourself - http://educate-yourself.org/nwo/\n\"The Hunger Games\" a Glimpse of the New World Order? - http://vigilantcitizen.com/moviesandtv/the-hunger-games-a-glimpse-at-the-new-world-order/\nDid the United Nations Just Introduce a New World Order? - http://www.charismanews.com/opinion/52333-did-the-united-nations-just-introduce-a-new-world-order\nNew World Order Master Plan - https://eyreinternational.wordpress.com/2012/04/09/the-horrific-new-world-order-master-plan-that-has-full-un-approval/\nChronological History of the New World Order - http://www.constitution.org/col/cuddy_nwo.htm\nBig Pharma wiki - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Pharma_conspiracy_theory\nThe Evils of Big Pharma Exposed - http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-evils-of-big-pharma-exposed/5425382\nIlluminati - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati\nMark Dice official website - http://www.markdice.com/\nG.

She wants to empower us all to help all ghosts: this is the compassion we will want for ourselves, by using The Crossing Over Prayer\u00a9 on GhostHelpers.com and in \u201cThe Crossing Over Prayer Book\u00a9.\u201d When a psychic only connects to a dead person, the ghosts do not receive the critical assistance they desperately need. Tina has studied\nmetaphysics all her life, gaining insight into the mystical world of magic and spirituality. The author of eight books on metaphysics, her writing comes from an intense desire to know and understand the hard science behind the unseen world of action and reaction combined with a sincere desire to share this understanding with other knowledge seekers. Her lifelong studies into the deeper meaning of events and actions were further enhanced by the experiences of a dynamic 20-year career in the Navy, working for the U.S. Submarine Force, retiring at the Commander level.\n\n\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5 \ud835\udde7\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddee: \nWebsite: http://Ghosthelpers.com/\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tina-erwin-0a5b8919/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@ghosthelpers5675\n\n\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddfc \ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude01 \ud835\udde7\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddee you can email: Contact@Ghosthelpers.com\n\nPlease leave a 5 Star Written Apple review if you enjoyed the podcast and share the link with family and friends https://apple.co/3PMKlT1 and subscribe to my Rumble Channel\n\n\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5 \ud835\udde6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude03\ud835\uddf2:\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/stevecloward1\nYouTube: https://youtube.com/@stevecloward \nTelegram: https://t.me/truthtalkwithsteve\nWebsite: www.truthtalkwithsteve.com\n___________________________________________________________\n\ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6c \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude68\n\n\ud835\ude03\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf2\ud835\udde6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfa \ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude05 - 1300+ channels, local and all the premium movie channels with \ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc0e \ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc07\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc18 \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc14\ud835\udc01\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc0d. \n https://vseestreambox.tv/step/vseebox-checkout/\nUse Coupon code TTWS and save 20% today\n\n\ud835\udc01\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc01\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1e \n\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc33\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc18\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c with our \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc25-\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc27-\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c & \ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 platform.   \nhttps://backbonelms.io\n\n\ud835\udc07\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc07\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\nImprove your health and the way you feel.

Sure, there are the arguments that if you get divorced she could tap into your retirement fund or the Duluth Model could skew things against you - but before you\u2019re able to get to the point that it produces less of a burden in areas of life that you can\u2019t control and a greater ability to live the life of minimalism and production, you are met with what? \nShaming lines. \n\nAnd that\u2019s where we are, once again - with shaming lines volume eight. If you\u2019ve missed my first seven, check them out, but we are going to look at four common shaming lines thrown at MGTOW men today.\nAnd no, I did not write the majority of this video in my cush chair in my study with my $2,000 mac desktop computer.  I wrote this in the notes app on my iPhone on an airplane. But, character is more important than content. \n\n1) A real man raises another person\u2019s kid\n\n2) A real man watches and takes care of a wife\n\n3) \u201cYou\u2019re not going to live without a woman, right? You just haven\u2019t found one that matches your standards and is a good catch, like you my son.\u201d\n\n4) \u201cGetting married will finally straighten you out!\u201d\n\nConclusion\n\nSo men, in conclusion - what are the shaming lines hurled at you? This is volume eight, thus I know that there are more. \n\nIf you want to share another story with me, I want to hear it and I want to share it. Also, at the end of each video I\u2019ve been announcing that I want to put together a book - a collection of stories from MGTOW men sharing how they came to MGTOW and what MGTOW has done to benefit them. To take part in that, let me know at sunrisehoodie@gmail.com or on Twitter @sunrisehoodie. \n\nHoodies up men, hoodie is out!"}

This film reveals how essential Sorensen was to the administration, as Kennedy said: \"My intellectual blood bank\". Not only with the epic speech \"Ask not what your country can do for you - Ask what you can do for your country\" but as special counsel to the President. It was Sorensen who Kennedy entrusted with the future of mankind when he tasked him to write the letter to Khrushchev to get him to back down during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Prepare for the roller coaster ride of insider perspective as Sorensen takes you behind the scenes with Castro and the Cuban Missile Crisis, Bay Of Pigs, CIA deception, Khrushchev, Civil Rights, Caroline, John Jr., Jackie Kennedy, Joint Chiefs and a possible coup in America, revealing what he believed was a conspiracy to murder JFK and who had the capabilities."}

Moses was told it was grave sin even to mix the oil of one's anointing in the same measure for another, and anyone who puts it on a person not so designated was to be cut off (Exodus 30:33). The Hebrew text says that the oil is in Heb.mekudesh lacha, literally 'set apart', or' sanctified specifically unto you.' This prohibition was evident When Elisha asked Elijah for his mantle in which he told his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 it is not mine to give. He was told to wait and see if the Lord would place it on him ( Kings 2: 10) If he saw him taken to heaven he would receive the blessing. Yet he had to leave for it to be placed on him. 2 Kings 13:21 (adapted from PROPHECY TODAY, Volume 11, No. 6, Is the 'Toronto Blessing' a Hands-On Experience?

With a heavy heart at the tearful farewell to actor Antonio Banderas, he was confirmed as...\n\n#antoniobanderas \n\nJos\u00e9 Antonio Dom\u00ednguez Bandera (born 10 August 1960), known professionally as Antonio Banderas, is a Spanish actor and singer. Known for his work in films of several genres, he has received various accolades, including a Cannes Film Festival Award and a European Film Award, in addition to nominations for an Academy Award, a Tony Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards, and five Golden Globe Awards.\n\nBanderas began his acting career with a series of films by director Pedro Almod\u00f3var in the 1980s; he then appeared in several Hollywood films, such as Philadelphia (1993), Interview with the Vampire (1994), Desperado (1995), Assassins (1995), Evita (1996), and The Mask of Zorro (1998). He also appeared in the Spy Kids series and provided the voice of Puss in Boots in the Shrek franchise and its spin-off film Puss in Boots in 2011.\n\nIn 2003, Banderas made his US theatre debut as Guido Contini in Nine, for which he was nominated for a Tony Award and won a Drama Desk Award. He received Primetime Emmy Award nominations for his roles in the television film And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself (2004) and the second season of Genius (2018); his portrayal of Pablo Picasso in the latter garnered him critical praise.\n\nFor the 2019 film Pain and Glory, Banderas earned the Cannes Film Festival Award, European Film Award and Goya Award for Best Actor, and received nominations for the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Actor.\n\nJos\u00e9 Antonio Dom\u00ednguez Bandera[1] was born on 10 August 1960 in M\u00e1laga,[2] to Civil Guard gendarme officer Jos\u00e9 Dom\u00ednguez Prieto (1920\u20132008) and schoolteacher Ana Bandera Gallego (1933\u20132017).[3][4] He has a younger brother named Francisco.[4] As a little boy, Banderas wanted to become a professional football player until a broken foot sidelined his dreams at the age of 15. He showed a strong interest in the performing arts and formed part of the ARA Theatre-School run by \u00c1ngeles Rubio-Arg\u00fcelles y Alessandri (wife of diplomat and filmmaker Edgar Neville) and the College of Dramatic Art, both in M\u00e1laga. His work in the theater and his performances on the streets eventually landed him a spot with the Spanish National Theatre.\n\nBanderas began his acting studies at the School of Dramatic Art in M\u00e1laga, and made his acting debut at a small theatre in M\u00e1laga. He was arrested by the Spanish police for performance in a play by Bertolt Brecht, because of political censorship under the rule of General Francisco Franco. Banderas spent a whole night at the police station; he had three or four such arrests while he was working with a small theatre troupe that toured all over Spain and was giving performances in small town theatres and on the street.[6][unreliable source] Banderas began working in small shops during Spain's post-dictatorial cultural movement known as the La Movida Madrile\u00f1a.[7]\n\nWhile performing with the theatre, Banderas caught the attention of Spanish director Pedro Almod\u00f3var, who cast the young actor in his 1982 film debut Labyrinth of Passion. Five years later, he went on to appear in the director's Law of Desire (1987), making headlines with his performance as a gay man, which required him to engage in his first male-to-male onscreen kiss. After Banderas appeared in Almod\u00f3var's 1986 Matador, the director cast him in his internationally acclaimed 1988 film, Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. The recognition Banderas gained for his role increased, years later, when he starred in Almod\u00f3var's controversial Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1989) as a mental patient who kidnaps a porn star (Victoria Abril) and keeps her tied up until she returns his love.[5] His breakthrough role in Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! helped spur him on to Hollywood.[8] Almod\u00f3var is credited for helping launch Banderas's international career, as he became a regular feature in his films throughout the 1980s.\n\nIn 1991, Madonna introduced Banderas to Hollywood. (He was an object of her desires in her pseudodocumentary film of one of her concert tours, Madonna: Truth or Dare.)[10] The following year, still speaking minimal English, he began acting in U.S. films. Despite having to learn all his lines phonetically, Banderas still managed to turn in a critically praised performance as a struggling musician in his first American drama film, The Mambo Kings (1992).[11]\n\nBanderas then broke through to mainstream American audiences in the Jonathan Demme film Philadelphia (1993), as the life-long partner of lawyer Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks), who has AIDS"}

Team 1: 'The 13 Objects' Team, Team 2 : GNA & Team 3 :W Aquilae. \n\nThis is totally fascinating.\n\nOther Astronomers and Science communicators are quick to doubt all of the findings. Very Interesting.\n\nGod Bless everyone,\n\nT\n\n@newTHOR on Twitter\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thornewsgo\n\n'The Serendipitous Discovery of a New Solar System Object with ALMA'\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02650v1.pdf?\n\n\nArticle by Phil Plait\n\nhttp://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/12/10/extreme_tnos_very_distant_solar_system_objects_may_have_been_found.html\n\n\"Team One: W Aql\n\nBoth teams used observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (or ALMA). One team was observing the nearby star Alpha Centauri (or Alpha Cen for short), and the other team the more distant W Aquilae (or W Aql).\n\nThe latter observation is easier to explain, so I\u2019ll start there. They observed W Aql in March and again in April 2014. They saw a source in the first observation that appeared to move by the time of the second. A third observation was made in May 2014, but nothing was seen. Given how much it appeared to move, and how bright it is, they conclude it is consistent with an object in the solar system, no farther than about 600 billion kilometers from the Sun.\n\nIf it\u2019s far away it could be a planet-sized object, but if it\u2019s closer it would have to be smaller. It could be one of the smaller icy worlds well outside Neptune\u2019s orbit; it\u2019s suspected million may exist with diameters of a few hundred or thousand km. Heck, Pluto and Eris are (large) examples of them, and different populations of them may extend past Neptune for hundreds of billions of km. So it\u2019s not too weird to wonder if this were one of those (and to be honest, if this is real, I\u2019d bet this is what it is).\n\nOr it might not exist at all. Bear that in mind.\n\nTeam Two: Alpha Cen\n\nThe second team were looking for planets around the two stars that make up the binary system of Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system in space to the Sun. One planet was claimed to have been found in 2012, but since then has fallen into controversy. Another group looked at the data and said the planet was a spurious result; in other words, not real.\n\nStill, that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t a planet there. The problem is, the stars are so bright they\u2019d drown out any much fainter nearby planets. Looking at longer wavelength light makes that easier; the stars don\u2019t put out much light at those wavelengths, while planets (which are much cooler than stars) might. That makes the huge contrast far less an issue. That\u2019s why the astronomers used ALMA, which sees light in the millimeter wavelength range (the light we see with our eyes has a wavelength more like 500 nanometers, far shorter.)\n\nThey observed Alpha Centauri twice; once in July 2014 and again in May 2015. Like the first team, they too saw a moving source (see the picture at the top of the post). And, to their surprise, it moved along more or less with the stars!\""}

Men need to man up and give women the equality they fought so hard to achieve so that these women can then woman up and deal with everything like a man. Because once women get a taste of TRUE equality with equal rights and equal punishment they will hate it so much that they will beg for traditionalism to return. It is time to use gender equality to destroy gender equality. Because after all equality is fair, but that doesn\u2019t always mean equality is going to be fun.\" unquote. Well Luke thanks for the donation and topic. Women don't want equality they want equity. What you're proposing equality for them they got fifteen to twenty years ago and they were still crying that the traditional patriarchy was oppressing them. They want to have their cake and eat it too. They want equal outcomes even when they put out unequal effort. Plus equality is a weasel word. Most women have no idea what it really means. The reason women will never beg for traditionalism is because women have equality right now and most are loving it. Social media provides them way more attention then the old 1950s living arrangement of a husband and kids. Working is more fulfilling for them because they went stir crazy staying at home as housewives in the 1950s and 1960s. Remember they went to work outside the home as slaves to a corporation so they could set themselves free. Most still prefer that and are fine going off to work the way that men do. It was their new purpose once life got longer and they stopped being perpetually pregnant. Women will never beg for traditionalism. They would rather die and get eaten by cats with their digested remains being scooped up from the kitty litter. They will mulch up real nice. I don't want to got back to the future either when it comes to a future that resembles the 1950s. Feminism set us men free from having to be a plowshare so we could plow some pretty woman. At some point one of three things will happen. Number one we will use technology to reproduce like Brave New World. Number two populations will continue crashing until our civilization decomplexifies and we have to start living as subsistence farmers again. If that happens then we have traditionalism again because you need kids to help you work the land. Or number three there is a big war that wipes out most of industrial civilization and then \nwe once again go back to traditionalism. Luke I would be cheering for the world with technological reproduction. That's the real equality we need to see. Then men would work and put their surplus resources into reproduction and women would continues putting their surplus into cats and the male population would be fine using cloning or artificial wombs.

With a heavy heart at the tearful farewell of actress Reese Witherspoon, goodbye Reese Witherspoon.\n\n#reesewitherspoon \n\nLaura Jeanne Reese Witherspoon (born March 22, 1976) is an American actress and producer. The recipient of various accolades, including an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, and two Golden Globe Awards, she has consistently ranked among the world's highest-paid actresses. Time magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2006 and 2015, and Forbes listed her among the World's 100 Most Powerful Women in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Forbes named her the world's richest actress with an estimated net worth of $400 million.[1]\n\nWitherspoon began her career as a teenager, making her screen debut in The Man in the Moon (1991). Her breakthrough came in 1999 with a supporting role in Cruel Intentions, and for her portrayal of Tracy Flick in the black comedy Election. She gained wider recognition for playing Elle Woods in the comedy Legally Blonde (2001) and its 2003 sequel, and for starring in the romantic comedy Sweet Home Alabama (2002). In 2005, she gained critical acclaim and won the Academy Award for Best Actress for portraying June Carter Cash in the musical biopic Walk the Line.\n\nFollowing a career downturn, during which her sole box-office success was the romantic drama Water for Elephants (2011), Witherspoon made a comeback by producing and starring as Cheryl Strayed in the drama Wild (2014), which earned her a second nomination for Best Actress at the Academy Awards. She has since worked primarily in television, producing and starring in several female-led literary adaptations under her company Hello Sunshine. These include the HBO drama series Big Little Lies (2017\u20132019), the Apple TV+ drama series The Morning Show (2019\u2013present), and the Hulu miniseries Little Fires Everywhere (2020). For the first of these, she won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series.\n\nWitherspoon also owns a clothing company, Draper James, and she is involved in children's and women's advocacy organizations. She serves on the board of the Children's Defense Fund (CDF) and was named Global Ambassador of Avon Products in 2007, serving as honorary chair of the charitable Avon Foundation dedicated to women's causes.\n\nLaura Jeanne Reese Witherspoon was born on March 22, 1976,[2] at Southern Baptist Hospital, in New Orleans, Louisiana, while her father, John Draper Witherspoon, was a student at Tulane University medical school.[3][4] Her father was born in Georgia and served as a lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve.[5][6] He was in private practice as an otolaryngologist until 2012.[7] Her mother, Mary Elizabeth \"Betty\" (n\u00e9e Reese) Witherspoon, is from Harriman, Tennessee. She was a professor of nursing at Vanderbilt University and had a PhD in pediatric nursing.[8][9]\n\nReese Witherspoon has claimed descent from Scottish-born John Witherspoon, who signed the United States Declaration of Independence;[10][11] however, this claim has not been verified by the Society of the Descendants of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence genealogists.[12] Her parents are still legally married, although they separated in 1996.[13]\n\nWitherspoon was raised an Episcopalian, and has said she is proud of the \"definitive Southern upbringing\" she received. She has said it gave her \"a sense of family and tradition\" and taught her about \"being conscientious about people's feelings, being polite, being responsible and never taking for granted what you have in your life\".[14][15][16] At age seven, she was selected as a model for a florist's television advertisements, which motivated her to take acting lessons.[17] At age 11, she took first place in the Ten-State Talent Fair.[17] She received high grades in school,[17] loved reading, and considered herself \"a big dork who read loads of books\".[4] On mentioning her love for books, she said, \"I get crazy in a bookstore. It makes my heart beat hard because I want to buy everything.\"[18] She has been described as a \"multi-achiever\" and was nicknamed \"Little Type A\" by her parents.[19][20] She attended middle school at Harding Academy and graduated from the all-girls' Harpeth Hall School in Nashville, during which time she was a cheerleader.[21][14] She later attended Stanford University as an English literature major,[22] but left prior to completing her studies to pursue an acting career.[14]"}

Turn on many of the popular sitcoms on television today and the father is often viewed as the comic relief of the show. Dad is just there but is not involved with the things of the family. The depiction is sometimes funny on television but oh so sad if this is the case in real life. Fathers are so important in the development of their children. The Bible is clear that Fathers are to be spiritual leaders in the home.\u201d\n\nSo, what\u2019s going on here? \n\nAs you guys know, and for those of you who are new, each Sunday I take a look at some scripture or scriptures from the Bible and tie it into an appropriate message pertaining to MGTOW. So, that\u2019s what we will be doing today, and obviously, en lieu of Father\u2019s Day, we will be looking at a few passages pertaining to being a father.\n\nSome of you guys are fathers. Some of you guys are fighting to get custody of your kids or kid. Some of you guys are like DDJ, Misandry Today, having fought twice to get custody of kids, getting all four kids eventually after much toil and massive amounts of money. That\u2019s an unbelievable fight. \n\nBut, obviously, in this MGTOW community, there are many men that aren\u2019t fathers. No matter what, we have all had fathers. Sadly, I couldn\u2019t spend much of the day with my dad, but I was able to see him and leave him a little something. I would not be where I am today without my father. The life that my father has afforded me with his efforts is something that I can never thank him enough for, the consistency he\u2019s provided and the example in being a man. I\u2019m thankful. Also, I believe that strong fathers naturally lead men to consider MGTOW, even if the father or the son have no idea what MGTOW is. A strong father, a positive, male influence, will naturally lean towards the red pill messages of the world. That\u2019s the strength of masculinity. \n\nGoing back to what the passage said that I just read, \u201cthe Fathers are to be spiritual leaders in the home.\u201d If that is the case, and now, fatherless homes are almost preferred in the western world, where does the spiritual direction go? It doesn\u2019t. It vanishes, it disappears, it becomes no more. Obviously, we hear the stories of single mothers raising their children in the home with spiritual direction, and sure, this does happen, but that child is going to be severely lacking, as the father-child relationship, the husband-wife relationship is the only worldy reflection of the relationship that the Christian is supposed to have with God. If that is not present, then there is no reflection of it. If you have no reflection of it, what do you follow? You follow external affirmation, you follow the media, you follow the fleshly mind and you ultimately end up following something other than you need to follow, and often the government. The government often comes in and supplants this. \n\nWhat did Hitler say...the easiest way to control a people is to remove the father from the home...that is what he said, and that is what he did. The world becomes tame, the world becomes spineless and the sons become directionless and the daughters become licentious. That is where I see the crumbling of the world beginning, and that\u2019s what is at stake today. So, I say this to you fathers out there right now. You may have had your soul punched in and you may never be out there again in the same form that you once believed that you were, and you may believe that the way that you\u2019re able to influence your child is tarnished because you\u2019ve gotta split custody, but if you want to have an impact and you want to influence the world, despite feeling as if you\u2019re in a broken and defeated state, do whatever you have to do to get back up on your feet, rally yourself and be there. Be a director, speak up and be a guide. Because if you don\u2019t, that becomes a conduit of destruction in the life of your child and the world around you. You accomplish something, and I say this, even to you MGTOW men out there. \n\n#hoodiesup"}

However, the developers modified the storylines in order to fit the movies into six subsections per movie. Barnett College, Dr. Indiana Jones' teaching location from Last Crusade, serves as the main hub of the game, and different maps on the walls allow access to each of the missions, extra unlockable content and options are found in the different classrooms. Once a player chooses a mission, a cutscene begins that introduces the section of the movie being played. Notable scenes have been recreated from the movies, such as the memorable boulder escape and the battle on the rope bridge, or Walter Donovan choosing the incorrect Holy Grail.\n\n\u25ba Outro Song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2OhfdEDZ3k\n\u25ba Instagram: http://instagram.com/GLP_Mike\n\u25ba Twitter: https://twitter.com/GLPFeed\n\u25ba Twitch: http://twitch.tv/glplayground\n\u25ba Facebook: http://facebook.com/gLpLayground\n\n\n\n\nMovies in 4K and 1440P\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1cvljv8vQmRMPVtnAKZitfRGmQ2OGYoZ\nOur Recent Movies\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1cvljv8vQmQOpPYEoDelidg4A3SciA-B\nA-D Game Movies\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1cvljv8vQmRGd0tq8bezyN0QFHHtnoEe\nE-K Game Movies\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1cvljv8vQmTi2NRYbW8Y8eMdQzxfkOfr\nL-R Game Movies \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1cvljv8vQmSHy85leC3rx5-E8BwpOgZM\nS-Z Game Movies\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1cvljv8vQmSdCiQvhet-r0Cj31KdLvE_"}

This new series exposes people's relationships with their personal belongings as they forego everything they own \u2013 clothing, furniture, money and all coveted possessions \u2013 for 21 days.

On January 15 of last year, the Kingdom of Tonga experienced one of the most dramatic and catastrophic volcanic eruptions ever recorded.

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "Why is Sandman Here? - MGTOW \"Hope you're well, Sandman. To inspire men to think for themselves and hold women's lives in contempt in the same disposable way that women hold men's lives in contempt is a shared goal. Women see men as disposable \u2013 and that's exactly how men should see women's lives. Many people (both men and women) dislike the idea of Men Going Their Own Way. Why? Because we live in a gynocentric society. A woman first society. Feminism is nothing more than hypergynocentrism and men that dislike MGTOW generally do so because they have daughters that might suffer from men opting out, haven't yet been divorce raped, or are seriously naive or they are beta male servants of the gynocracy. And beta male servants of the gynocracy very often mistakenly see themselves as alpha males. They \"white knight\" and/or \"damsel\" the gynocracy to curry favor. Additionally, marriage and divorce are multi-billion dollar a year businesses - so there are many that have their livelihoods and hopes for financial security tied to marriage and/or divorce \u2013 especially women. The #1 way in which men's lives are destroyed is through marriage, divorce and/or false accusations. MGTOW's primary advice to men is to never get married or otherwise give a woman any significant power over their lives; thereby limiting women's and in-law's \ndestructive power. The vast majority of men's problems evaporate simply by limiting women's social, physical, emotional, psychological, legal and financial power over their lives. It's easy to see why many people see MGTOW as a threat to their security and financial goals. The goal of those opposed to MGTOW is to discredit MGTOW and paint the MGTOW mindset in a negative light in order to keep men on the plantation. This is typically accomplished through all forms of shaming and may even result in social and financial ostracization through job loss and/or false accusations. Several great books that cover the primary ideals of the MGTOW mindset but are not books specifically on MGTOW. The Myth of Male Power, Stand by Your Manhood, (Women First, Men Last) and The Manipulated Man come to mind. Anyway, my question to you Sandman is this: Why do you invest so much of yourself into the MGTOW community? \n\n\n\n\n\nNeo's In The Matrix\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC85ymP8KqT597cQNeihYmuQ\n\n\n\n\n\n10 pictures paid for and licensed through BigStock.com (In order of appearance)\n\n1. prometeus - Trendy DJ party girl in bright clothes, headphones and with bright pink dreadlocks.\nhttp://www.bigstockphoto.com/image-98406158/stock-photo-trendy-dj-party-girl-in-bright-clothes%2C-headphones-and-with-bright-pink-dreadlocks-disco%2C-party-show-business-bright-fashion\n\n2.

{"label": "harmless", "sentence": "The MGTOW Crib The MGTOW Crib\n\n\"Hi Sandman, I would like you to discuss Real Estate. You get into a good amount of real estate knowledge in your War on Single Men video I would like you to elaborate. Specifically leverage, debt, costs associated with buying or selling a personal home, short and long term expenses and income. I am an advocate of owning one's own residence for hedge against rent increases, freedom from fickle landlords and (after some time) the available equity can be accessed easier than any other source of money. Of course maintenance costs, property taxes and higher mortgage payments vs. rent are not good but in my opinion over the long haul buying, owning and paying off one's own residence is preferable to renting. Please discuss and thanks for your channel.\" Well Mr. Unknown thanks for your donation and topic request. I will keep your information confidential except for one thing, that you live in the city of Los Angeles so you know exactly how expensive and unaffordable real estate can be. I agree with you that purchasing your own home is cheaper over the long haul especially in a place like the United States where get to write off the interest you pay on your property. Plus you can get a fixed long-term mortgage at three to four percent now so you know what you'll be paying. Currently I don't own property but I did before and let me tell you why. First of all here in Canada we can't write off our mortgage interest unless it's an investment property. The savings on the Canadian end of things is that we don't have any inheritance taxes when we die and homes get passed onto the next generation tax free if they are your personal residence. Second, the prices in Toronto are insane. An average three bedroom home costs well over a million dollars and will probably be one and a half to two million dollars if the trend continues for another year or two. Yes owing real estate makes sense if you bought it a long time ago or you purchase it during a downturn or you buy a cheap home for at most a few hundred thousand dollars per year. That being said you're right about rents going through the roof. I've included a video in the description called \"No fixed address: Affordable housing is scarce in Toronto\" where the female anchor got a nine hundred and fifty dollar increase per month on her downtown condo when her lease expired. If the building is twenty-five years or newer the landlord can increase the price at whatever rate they want. Her rent increase was almost forty percent from one month to the next. So she's couch surfing, house sitting and living with her dad and she makes sixty to seventy thousand dollars a year. She's living in her car and keeps her wardrobe in her trunk. The average appartment price in the area she was living in is over half a million dollars for a nice one bedroom. Watch the video and let me know what you think. Do you really think people would let her stay in their homes if she wasn't as good looking or as young. As for value Mr. Unknown if it was the year two thousand after the dotcom bust that was the best time to buy real estate in both Canada and the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo fixed address: Affordable housing is scarce in Toronto\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9z-c-zutsA\n\nMGTOW Mystery Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edSXBfj7rb4&t=0s\n\n\n\n\n\nAll video footage is paid for and licensed to Sandman."}

In this video we consider the problem of depression, which is a real illness. It is also noted that antidepressants can be a first and only resort. There is an argument that antidepressants are overprescribed. Whether they are prescribed or not other strategies should also be \nconsidered. These include assessment of nutritional deficiency, such of lack of vitamin D. A good diet with plenty of fibre to promote the microbiome.

Why are the schools, bars and restaurants closed again? \n\nMichael does a deep dive into Klaus Schwab's two recent books on the coming Reset in order to answer these questions and, whether you're Democrat, Republican or Libertarian, you need to know what's coming.

{"label": "harmless", "sentence": "A Teen\u2019s Suicide Story Now Provides Parents With Hope Our teenagers are facing a mental health crisis and life challenges that are completely unlike those faced by other generations. Nearly 1 in 10 high school students admitted they had tried to take their own life in the previous 12 months, according to a survey published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and 1 in 5 had seriously considered it. Teenage mental health presents enormous challenges for parents and grandparents, who desperately want to help, guide, soothe and love their teenagers, but don\u2019t know how in this drastically changed environment.\n \nIn this firsthand account, 16-year-old Amy describes the warning signs her parents missed before she tried to die by suicide and provides advice to adults on how they can better understand and help a young person in crisis. Amy\u2019s suicidal warning signs included wearing dirty clothes to school, not brushing her teeth, or doing her homework, and sleeping all the time. She says her parents aren\u2019t to blame because they didn\u2019t know what warning signs to look out for, but she wishes they had validated her pain and gotten her professional help instead of just giving her a hug and saying everything would be fine.\n \nAmy overdosed on pills and ended up in the ER. Luckily, she survived. Since then, she has found the help she needed through a combination of therapies, mental health support at school and, most important, getting closer to her dad, who she realized \u201creally is a pretty great father.\u201d Amy says she has learned from all of her trauma and pain and loves the person she is today. She encourages parents of teens not to take it personally if their teenager is struggling and to just \u201cstay at it.\u201d\n \nFor help, call the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988.\n\nIf you want to be notified of stories like Teen's Suicide Story Provides Parents with Hope, please *SUBSCRIBE* to our channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmyGH1tjNBs2VFtVSAtmNOg.\nHear more *REAL PEOPLE STORIES* stories here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXQ-JEOv9JjEBEtb2V5pnD-f9KPIgJlm9\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:22 What Parents should know about teen suicide\n01:26 Teen suicide rate rose nearly 53% between 2010 and 2020\n02:35 What parents can do to help a struggling child\n04:09 One in ten high schools say they attempted to take their life in the past year\n\nPlease consider supporting more content like this by becoming an AARP member: https://www.aarp.org/becomeamember\n\nConnect with AARP Online:\nVisit us: http://aarp.org\nLike us on Facebook: http://facebook.com/AARP\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/AARP\n\nAARP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to helping people ages 50 and older to improve their quality of life as they age.

Zack is a barista who doesn't make big tips, and Miri isn't exactly making top dollar either. Friends since grade school, they share a cramped apartment together, but the bills are piling up faster than their paychecks. Then, at their class reunion, the two friends meet up with a former classmate who's shot to success in the adult film industry. Inspired after a YouTube video of Miri in her granny panties goes viral, Zack and his roommate round up a crew and begin production on their masterpiece. When the time comes for Zack and Miri to shoot their first scene together, however, unexpected emotions start to bubble to the surface, prompting them both to wonder if they've somehow mistaken true love for mere friendship all these years.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \u00a9 The Weinstein Company (2008)\nCast: Elizabeth Banks, Brandon Routh\nDirector: Kevin Smith\nProducers: Carla Gardini, Laura Greenlee, Scott Mosier, Bob Weinstein, Harvey Weinstein, Leslie Rodier\nScreenwriter: Kevin Smith\n\nWHO ARE WE?\nThe MOVIECLIPS channel is the largest collection of licensed movie clips on the web.

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "Vitamin D kills the flu virus so STOP BLOCKING OUR SUNLIGHT ! Did you know JP-8 jet fuel exposure suppresses the immune response to viral infections?-\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19022873?ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&linkpos=2&log$=relatedarticles&logdbfrom=pubmed\n\nSo why are they spraying chemtrails or chemical contrails which block out natural sunlight? WHY are they doing this? If the World Health Organisation were so concerned about the swine flu pandemic they would be aware that natural sunlight is a very good source for the body to make vitamin D and would be concerned about the artificial cloud covering which is being created by aircraft now worldwide. My first videos in April 2009 started with the heavy chemtrail spraying in my area showing blue skies turn a hazy white blocking out the sun for the rest of the day. I know from users who contact me that there is a 24/7 campaign of chemical spraying in the atmosphere in the USA. From my research I found that chemicals could be added to aviation fuel. Please see my video: \nCHEMTRAILS CHEMICALS ADDED TO AVIATION FUEL GOVERNMENT DOCUMENT NOW ONLINE-\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIPgdZcQUws  For the DEFRA documents. \n\nDEFRA says chemicals added to aviation fuel can be a cost effective way to spray a so-called protective screen as to block out the suns rays and reduce global warming. ( This however would have an opposite effect. Please look up Global Dimming and the Hydrological Cycle on Google. ) BUT, is this really about protecting the earth or is it about stopping you receiving natural sunlight and making vitamin D?\n\nVitamin D is important for helping the immune system fight the flu virus. One reason why the flu may be more contagious in the winter time is because of the lack of sunlight. The lack of sunlight prevents our skin from producing sufficient levels of vitamin D. There is now documented evidence about the roles of solar ultraviolet-B radiation and vitamin D in reducing case-fatality rates from the 1918-1918 influenza Pandemic in EU.\n\nI quote: There are two mechanisms whereby vitamin D can reduce the risk of death once the pandemic influenza virus infection took hold: reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced risk of bacterial pneumonia.\n\nThe type of vitamin D which can fight viruses can ONLY be made from natural sunlight. It is known as D3, which is made from sunlight when 7-dehydrocholesterol in our skin reacts with UV light.\n\nI quote: It is then twice activated in the liver and kidney to make 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. This attaches to receptors on genes that control their expression, which turn protein production on or off. Vitamin D regulates the expression of more than 1,000 genes throughout the body. They include genes in macrophages, cells in the immune system that, among other things, ATTACK AND DESTROY VIRUSES.\n\nA report in The Washington Post on August 3rd 2009 says:\nMillions of Children In U.S. are Found to Be Lacking Vitamin D-\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/02/AR2009080202114.html \n\nThere are articles documenting that exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation in sunlight before immunization suppresses systemic as well as local immune responses- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19450899?ordinalpos=6&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum  \n\nWhich mean the vaccination doesnt work so well as a unsuppressed immune response is needed to build up anti-bodies and immunity to that particular vaccine. So another reason to block out the natural sunlight.\n\nIf our governments were so concerned about the swine flu surely they would put a stop to these climate change experiments which blocks out everyones natural sunlight. The fact that they or the media will not even report on the chemtrails happening above us only leads me to be more suspicious of what the chemical spraying is really about.\n\nEpidemic Influenza And Vitamin D-\nhttp://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/51913.php\n\nRepeated Aerosol-vapor JP-8 Jet Fuel Exposure Affects Neurobehavior and Neurotransmitter Levels in a Rat Model-\nhttp://www.scribd.com/doc/17102227/Baldwin-Figueredo-Wright-Wong-Witten-2007\n\nThis video is a re-upload from tarot1984s channel-\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/tarot1984"}

NASA's rover recently discovered enormous amounts of water beneath the surface of Mars, which surprised many people who had previously thought of Mars as nothing more than a rocky and dusty planet. Mars is one of the most fascinating planets in our solar system. Mars is a world unto itself. One theory suggests that there was once life on this planet billions of years ago because the surface is solid. This red planet has long been a popular subject of fiction and science-fiction, but it is also a hotspot for researchers. The surface of Mars appears to be dry, at the very least. Researchers, however, believe that up to 99 percent of the water is still present. Instead of escaping into outer space, it sank into the martian sand and sandstone. All of Mars' primordial water had to go somewhere when the planet's atmosphere collapsed.

This thought has been weighing on my mind lately, and one that I've been wanting to deliver. \n\nMGTOW is for us, a unique breed. We\u2019ve felt this way just recently or for a long time, and they see a cheat code to the flawed and downtrodden world around them, and they\u2019re pursuing the best route for survival and most importantly, the best route to FLOURISH. When I see MGTOW being misconstrued\n\nI guess that\u2019s really what I want to talk about today in today\u2019s Sunday Sermon. The abasement of me, all the while the abounding of the various topics that I discuss. What passage will I be using today to discuss this? Well, as some of you know, I do love reading Paul. He\u2019s very direct, and there has been a passage that has been on my mind and it\u2019s in 1 Corinthians 9 in regards to Paul\u2019s Rights as an Apostle. I\u2019m also going to talk about one of my favorite discussions and topics within MGTOW, and that\u2019s discipline, and we are going to look at that again today towards the end of the chapter. \n\nI also discuss discipline and discipline as a pillar of the MGTOW philosophy. Discipline is a word that the world hears today and shudders upon hearing it. The world hears the word discipline and the world thinks pain, persecution and judgement. But, discipline is life giving, and I believe that the notion of discipline is a pillar within MGTOW. Discipline and putting off instant gratification for that which you know will benefit you far into the future. This discipline may even not even allow you to get the goal that you\u2019re pursuing in the semi-short term. But, the world wants it now, and if you say that you\u2019re holding out for the future and putting aside which may land you in the ditch while you\u2019re trying to stay on the track, you may get shamed back into the blue pill world you were trying to leave. \n\n#hoodiesup"}

{"label": "harmless", "sentence": "How to use invisible boob tape on tight fitted tops Invisible boob tape can be a great solution for wearing tight fitted tops without the need for a bra. To use it, start by cleaning and drying the area where the tape will be applied. \n\nCut a strip of tape that is long enough to fit across the width of your chest, from one side to the other. Then, apply the tape to the underside of one breast, making sure to smooth out any wrinkles or bubbles. Repeat with the other breast. Once both sides are taped, pull the top up and position your breasts in the desired location, using the tape to keep them securely in place. It's important to make sure the tape is holding everything in place and that you feel comfortable before heading out. And, when it's time to remove the tape, do so gently to avoid any discomfort or irritation."}

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "Blueface STILL CHEATING on Jaidyn - Thanksgiving Mess Blueface STILL CHEATING on Jaidyn - Thanksgiving Mess \n\nThe Blueface and Jaidyn drama just keeps getting worse, and it\u2019s happened again. Turns out, Blueface is still cheating on Jaidyn with Chrisean, and this whirlwind of a relationship might just never end. \n\nIn this video, we\u2019re going to bring you all the details of their insane relationship, and how unbelievable these three people have been for the entire time they\u2019ve been in the limelight. \n\nIn today's video, we look at Blueface STILL CHEATING on Jaidyn - Thanksgiving Mess. The ongoing story between Blueface, Jaidyn, and Cran continues to captivate audiences with its tumultuous twists and turns. Despite a decade-long history, Blueface and Jaidyn's relationship has been far from stable, plagued by repeated instances of infidelity. Cran's entry into the picture only adds fuel to the fire, with her and Blueface's tumultuous on-and-off relationship complicating matters further.\n\nFrom their initial encounter in high school to their recent engagement and two children together, Blueface and Jaidyn's journey has been anything but smooth. Despite being signed to Blueface's record label, Mil Music, Jaidyn has endured the heartache of Blueface's infidelities, particularly his ongoing involvement with Cran, who also shares a child with him.\n\nCran's role in Blueface's life adds another layer of complexity, with their relationship marked by a reality show, public spats, and accusations. Despite their ups and downs, including allegations of abuse and messy breakups, Cran's recent revelations suggest that Blueface's engagement to Jaidyn might be more of a publicity stunt than a genuine commitment, leaving fans questioning the sincerity of their relationship.\n\nBut, it's unclear what the future holds for this trio. With Jaidyn hinting at addressing the drama through her music and Cran sharing surprising details about her ongoing involvement with Blueface, the story shows no signs of slowing down. As fans eagerly await further developments, one thing remains certain: Blueface's tangled web of relationships continues to be a delighting spectacle of love, betrayal, and uncertainty.\n\nSubscribe for celebrity news, entertainment updates, celebrity gossip, celebrity underrated, entertainment news, reality tv, cringe, celeb news, and millionaire lifestyle.

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "10 minutes ago/ We have extremely sad news about singer Stevie Wonder, trying desperately. 10 minutes ago/ We have extremely sad news about singer Stevie Wonder, trying desperately.\n\n#steviewonder \n\nStevland Hardaway Morris (n\u00e9 Judkins; May 13, 1950), known professionally as Stevie Wonder, is an American singer-songwriter, who is credited as a pioneer and influence by musicians across a range of genres that include rhythm and blues, pop, soul, gospel, funk and jazz. A virtual one-man band, Wonder's use of synthesizers and other electronic musical instruments during the 1970s reshaped the conventions of R&B. He also helped drive the genre into the album era, crafting his LPs as cohesive, consistent socially conscious statements with complex compositions. Blind since shortly after his birth, Wonder was a child prodigy who signed with Motown's Tamla label at the age of 11, where he was given the professional name Little Stevie Wonder.\n\nWonder's single \"Fingertips\" was a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1963, at the age of 13, making him the youngest artist ever to top the chart. Wonder's critical success was at its peak in the 1970s. His \"classic period\" began in 1972 with the releases of Music of My Mind and Talking Book, the latter featuring \"Superstition\", which is one of the most distinctive and famous examples of the sound of the Hohner Clavinet keyboard. His works Innervisions (1973), Fulfillingness' First Finale (1974) and Songs in the Key of Life (1976) all won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, making him the tied-record holder for the most Album of the Year wins, with three. He is also the only artist to have won the award with three consecutive album releases. Wonder began his \"commercial period\" in the 1980s; he achieved his biggest hits and highest level of fame, had increased album sales, charity participation, high-profile collaborations (including Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson), political impact, and television appearances. Wonder has continued to remain active in music and political causes.\n\nWonder is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with sales of over 100 million records worldwide. He has won 25 Grammy Awards (the most by a solo artist) and one Academy Award (Best Original Song, for the 1984 film The Woman in Red). Wonder has been inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Songwriters Hall of Fame. He is also noted for his work as an activist for political causes, including his 1980 campaign to make Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a federal holiday in the U.S. In 2009, he was named a United Nations Messenger of Peace, and in 2014, he was honored with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nWonder was born Stevland Hardaway Judkins in Saginaw, Michigan, on May 13, 1950,[7] the third of five children born to Lula Mae Hardaway, and the second of Hardaway's two children with Calvin Judkins.[8] He was born six weeks premature which, along with the oxygen-rich atmosphere in the hospital incubator, resulted in retinopathy of prematurity, a condition in which the growth of the eyes is aborted and causes the retinas to detach, so he became blind.[9][10]\n\nWhen Wonder was four, his mother divorced his father and moved with her three children to Detroit, Michigan, where Wonder sang as a child in a choir at the Whitestone Baptist Church.[11] She later rekindled her relationship with her first child's father (whose surname was also coincidentally Hardaway)[8] and changed her own name back to Lula Hardaway, going on to have two more children. She later also changed Stevie's surname to Morris, partly because of relatives.[citation needed][clarification needed] Wonder has retained Morris as his legal surname. He began playing instruments at an early age, including piano, harmonica, and drums. He formed a singing partnership with a friend; calling themselves Stevie and John, they played on street corners and occasionally at parties and dances.[12]\n\nAs a child, Wonder attended Fitzgerald Elementary School in Detroit.[13] After his first album was released, The Jazz Soul of Little Stevie (1962), he enrolled in Michigan School for the Blind in Lansing, Michigan."}

This generation is characterized by their entrepreneurial spirit, technological proficiency, and desire for financial independence. Several reasons contribute to the preference for low-cost and profitable business ventures among Gen Z:\n\n1. Financial constraints: Gen Z individuals often face financial constraints due to factors such as student loans, rising living costs, and limited job opportunities. Starting a low-cost business allows them to enter the entrepreneurial world without requiring substantial upfront investments or taking on significant debt.\n\n2. Flexibility and independence: Gen Z values flexibility and independence in their work. By starting a low-cost business, they have the freedom to set their own schedules, work from anywhere, and pursue their passions. This generation seeks work-life balance and values the ability to control their own destiny.\n\n3. Technological proficiency: Gen Z is the first generation to grow up in a fully digital era. They have an innate understanding of technology, social media, and online platforms. This proficiency enables them to leverage digital tools and marketing strategies to start and grow low-cost businesses. \n\n4. Creative opportunities: Gen Z is known for their creativity and innovative thinking. They are constantly seeking new ways to disrupt traditional business models and find unique solutions to existing problems.\n\n5. Social and environmental consciousness: Gen Z places a strong emphasis on social and environmental responsibility. They are more likely to support businesses that align with their values, such as those focused on sustainability, ethical practices, and social impact. \n\n6. Job market uncertainty: Gen Z witnessed the economic challenges faced by previous generations, particularly during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. This experience has made them wary of relying solely on traditional employment and seeking alternative sources of income.\n\nSo, make a Full Watch worth and for never missing any update you can FREE to \nSUBSCRIBE US:- https://www.youtube.com/busyfunda\n\nDisclaimer:- \nThis video is just for providing knowledge and updates to viewers, this content is made through internet research, this video has no intention to the heart or promotes any brand/company/startup, this video is only made for knowledge, education, entertainment purposes, and there is no promotion at all.\n\n\"This channel and I do not claim any right over any of the graphics, images, songs used in this video.

Jackson Is Pass Away Expected Soon Family Prepare To Say Goodbye.\n\n#samuelljackson \n\nSamuel Leroy Jackson (born December 21, 1948) is an American actor. One of the most widely recognized actors of his generation, the films in which he has appeared have collectively grossed over $27 billion worldwide, making him the second highest-grossing person in film of all time, only behind Stan Lee.\n\nHe rose to fame with films such as Coming to America (1988), Goodfellas (1990), Patriot Games (1992), Juice (1992), Menace II Society (1993), True Romance (1993), Jurassic Park (1993), and Fresh (1994). Jackson continued gaining greater prominence for his collaborations with director Spike Lee in the films School Daze (1988), Do the Right Thing (1989), Mo' Better Blues (1990), Jungle Fever (1991), Oldboy (2013) and Chi-Raq (2015) and in the Quentin Tarantino films Pulp Fiction (1994), Jackie Brown (1997), Django Unchained (2012), and The Hateful Eight (2015). For his role in Pulp Fiction, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nJackson is a highly prolific actor, having appeared in over 150 films. His other roles include Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995), A Time to Kill (1996), Hard Eight (1996), Eve's Bayou (1997), The Red Violin (1998), The Negotiator (1998), Unbreakable (2000), Shaft (2000) and its 2019 sequel/reboot, Coach Carter (2005), Snakes on a Plane (2006), The Other Guys (2010), Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014), Kong: Skull Island (2017), and Glass (2019). Jackson also won widespread recognition as the Jedi Mace Windu in the Star Wars prequel trilogy (1999\u20132005), later voicing the role in the animated film Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008) and alongside in the video game Lego Star Wars: The Clone Wars. With his permission, his likeness was used for the Ultimate version of the Marvel Comics character Nick Fury; he subsequently played Fury in 11 Marvel Cinematic Universe films, beginning with a cameo appearance in Iron Man (2008), as well as guest-starring in the television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. He will reprise this role in the upcoming Disney+ series Secret Invasion, which is set to premiere in early 2023.[5][6]\n\nJackson has provided his voice for several animated films, documentaries, television series, and video games, including Lucius Best/Frozone in the Pixar films The Incredibles (2004) and Incredibles 2 (2018), Whiplash in Turbo (2013), the title character of the anime television series Afro Samurai (2007), and Frank Tenpenny in the video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2004). In 2016, Jackson served as the narrator of the acclaimed documentary I Am Not Your Negro based on James Baldwin's writings.\n\nIn March 2022, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences honored Jackson by awarding him an Academy Honorary Award, which is intended \"to honor extraordinary distinction in lifetime achievement, exceptional contributions to the state of motion picture arts and sciences, or for outstanding service to the Academy\".\n\nSamuel Leroy Jackson was born in Washington, D.C., on December 21, 1948,[9] the only child of Elizabeth Harriett (n\u00e9e Montgomery) and Roy Henry Jackson.[10][11] He grew up in Chattanooga, Tennessee.[9][12] His father lived away from the family in Kansas City, Missouri, and later died of alcoholism. Jackson met him only twice during his life.[13][14] He was raised by his mother, a factory worker and later a supplies buyer for a mental institution; he was also raised by his maternal grandparents, Edgar and Pearl Montgomery, as well as extended family.[11][13][15] According to DNA tests, Jackson partially descends from the Benga people of Gabon, and he became a naturalized citizen of Gabon in 2019.[16] He attended several segregated schools[17] and graduated from Riverside High School in Chattanooga.[9] He played the French horn, piccolo, trumpet, and flute in the school orchestra.[18][19] He developed a stutter during childhood and learned to \"pretend to be other people who didn't stutter\". He still uses the word \"motherfucker\" to get through a speech block. He still has days where he stutters.[19][20] Initially intent on pursuing a degree in marine biology, he attended Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia.[9] After joining a local acting group to earn extra points in a class, he found an interest in acting and switched his major.[21] Before graduating in 1972, he co-founded the Just Us Theatre.[13][22]\n\nAfter Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination in 1968, Jackson attended King's funeral in Atlanta as one of the ushers.[23] He then travelled to Memphis, Tennessee, to join an equal rights protest march. In a 2005 Parade interview, he revealed, \"I was angry about the assassination, but I wasn't shocked by it. I knew that change was going to take something different \u2013 not sit-ins, not peaceful coexistence.\""}

It's like a river that's run dry; without its nourishing flow, our mental and physical landscapes can become barren.\n\nOur approach focuses on replenishing and balancing your Qi through acupuncture, herbs, and lifestyle adjustments, offering a path to restore that inner vitality and emotional equilibrium.\u00a0\n\nRemember, depression is not just a battle of the mind; it's a conversation with your entire being.

Urged to abandon the only home he\u2019s ever known, Mowgli embarks on a captivating journey of self-discovery, guided by panther-turned-stern mentor Bagheera (voice of Ben Kingsley), and the free-spirited bear Baloo (voice of Bill Murray). Along the way, Mowgli encounters jungle creatures who don\u2019t exactly have his best interests at heart, including Kaa (voice of Scarlett Johansson), a python whose seductive voice and gaze hypnotizes the man-cub, and the smooth-talking King Louie (voice of Christopher Walken), who tries to coerce Mowgli into giving up the secret to the elusive and deadly red flower: fire. The all-star cast also includes Lupita Nyong'o as the voice of the fiercely protective mother wolf Raksha, and Giancarlo Esposito as the voice of wolf pack\u2019s alpha male Akela. \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d seamlessly blends live-action with photorealistic CGI animals and environments, using up-to-the-minute technology and storytelling techniques to immerse audiences in an enchanting and lush world.\n\nDirector: Jon Favreau\nProducers: Jon Favreau and Brigham Taylor\nStarring: Neel Sethi, Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, Christopher Walkern, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Idris Elba, Scarlett Johansson, Giancarlo Esposito"}

{"label": "harmless", "sentence": "BUSTED Taliban offered to hand over Bin Laden in February 2001 BUSH REJECTED OFFER On 21st February 2001 (7 MONTHS BEFORE 9/11) The Taliban offered to hand over Osama Bin Laden in return for lifting the sanctions that were placed on the country. They also desperately tried to hand Bin Laden over to the USA after a week of heavy bombing when the war started in Afghanistan as so many civilians were being killed.\n\nThe Independent- Bush rejects Taliban offer to surrender bin Laden-\n\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/bush-rejects-taliban-offer-to-surrender-bin-laden-631436.html\n\nAfter a week of debilitating strikes at targets across Afghanistan, the Taliban repeated an offer to hand over Osama bin Laden, only to be rejected by President Bush.\n\nThe move came as the Taliban granted foreign journalists unprecedented access to the interior for the first time. Reporters were escorted to the village of Karam in southern Afghanistan, where the Taliban said up to 200 civilians were killed in an American bombardment last Wednesday.\n\nThe reporters saw clear evidence that many civilians had been killed in the attack, though they could not confirm the number of deaths. \"I ask America not to kill us,\" pleaded Hussain Khan, who said he had lost four children in the raid. In the rubble of one house, the remains of an arm stuck out from beneath a pile of bricks. A leg had been uncovered near by.\n\nAnother old man said: \"We are poor people, don't hit us. We have nothing to do with Osama bin Laden. We are innocent people.\" Washington has not commented on the bombardment.\n\nMr Kabir said: \"If America were to step back from the current policy, then we could negotiate.\" Mr bin Laden could be handed over to a third country for trial, he said. \"We could discuss which third country.\"\n\nBut as American warplanes entered the second week of the bombing campaign, Washington rejected the Taliban offer out of hand. \"When I said no negotiations I meant no negotiations,\" Mr Bush said. \"We know he's guilty. Turn him over. There's no need to discuss innocence or guilt.\"\n\nThanks to zedalis for the original upload in 2006 !"}

It turns out, things were even worse behind closed doors. \n\nIn today's video, we look at EXPOSURE: Breaking Down the Jada and Will Smith Controversy. Here, we explore Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith's marriage controversy. From their seemingly idyllic partnership to the underlying complexities that plagued their relationship, every facet is scrutinized. Jada's close friendship with Tupac Shakur raises questions about its impact on her bond with Will. Despite claims of a loving connection, Tupac's lingering presence in Jada's life adds fuel to the speculation surrounding their marriage's demise.\n\nWe also know that, including Jada's admission of a fling with August Alsina during a turbulent period in her marriage. While unconventional, Will and Jada's open communication about their non-traditional relationship sheds light on their commitment to transparency. However, the cracks in their union became apparent, culminating in a dramatic incident at the 2022 Academy Awards involving Chris Rock's controversial joke.\n\nFrom this video, we can also learn the financial implications of a potential divorce, with their combined $400 million fortune and the absence of a prenuptial agreement adding complexity to their separation. Despite the turmoil, the question lingers: why haven't they pursued a divorce? Could lingering affection for Tupac or financial entanglements be the key factors in their decision to remain legally bound while emotionally estranged?\n\nSo, let's watch the entire video and learn about the Jada and Will Smith controversy, shedding light on the inner workings of one of Hollywood's most scrutinized relationships.

It\u2019s time for more awesome clothes hacks to improve your wardrobe. Everyone gets bored with their clothes eventually, but we can always give outfits a second life with some creativity, bleach, and paint. Are you ready? Let\u2019s begin with a colorful geometric pattern that you can create on a T-shirt using tape and paint. The result is breath-taking!\n\nNext up, we have a very original tie-dye idea: using a dark T-shirt and bleach to create the pattern. Now you have a very original shirt. Another way to use bleach to decorate your clothes is by using a stamp. Just be careful it doesn\u2019t drip all over the place. If you put some bleach in a little bottle, you can draw stars and other designs on dark garments.  Take note of this one, because we think you\u2019ll love it. Use an old toothbrush and bleach to create wave-like patterns on your black sneakers.

I remember when I was a little kid, I used to play baseball and my mom used to come and watch the game everyday. The problem is when I was a little kid and playing baseball, I used to suck. I would go through a whole season without getting a hit. It used to be embarrassing because my mom used to watch.\n\nOne day, her birthday came along and I told her since it was her birthday, I'm gonna get a hit for her. I was determined to get a hit for her because it was her birthday, you could imagine that as a kid if it's your mom's birthday you're gonna put all your heart to it, right?  I didn't get the hit so my mom was like \"It's cool\".\n\nI was thinking about that and it's true. It doesn't matter how much you want something, grit and determination are not gonna help you out. What's gonna help you out is two things:\n\n1. Time - If you're someone who practices twice a day as supposed to someone who practices once a day, in two years, you're gonna be better than that person. It's not because you have a special God-given gift, there's something behind it that's real--and that real thing is you putting the time. That will create something in the long run that's real and felt.\n\n2. Deliberate Practice - Practicing the fundamentals consistently for over 10 years or practicing more than the next person, that's what's really gonna give you all the success because you need a skill-something that sets you apart.\n\nYou know when somebody is really good at something, it doesn't take long to realize that. You could tell, there's something different about high-level skillsets when you're seeing it in person, right? When you see it, you'll automatically stand out.\u00a0\n\nThe problem is that people operate with the mentality of \"I want things now\". It's how it is, we want things now. This means that we might want to achieve our goal but because of we sort of feel deep down that's to really be good at it, it requires us to lose time right now and lose our momentary pleasure---this is what most people don't want to do so they try to cheat the process. They try to go the easy route and find quick fixes. That then causes people to create subpar results.\n\nHere's a link to the article version: https://mindfulattraction.org/blog/2019/9/4/why-grit-and-determination-is-not-enough-to-succeed-heres-why\n\nCheck out my course Dark Game so you\u2019ll learn all the techniques needed for you to attract women. https://dalexis-school.thinkific.com/courses/dark-game"}

Here's what she briefly has to say: \"Hey Sandman, This is a bonus donation. If want to talk about something else then the Methree e-mail, its fine. I liked your chapel in the hills video. It\u2019s too bad I can\u2019t do donations for the Kool building channel. I guess this will do. For your information a cousin of mine decided my place would be great for a small Christmas party. I\u2019m hosting, decorating, in charge of shopping and food. It\u2019s a welcomed distraction and scary how on point the video is turning out.\" Well miss Fat Cat thanks for the kitty litter update and since you didn't give me as specific topic I'll be covering is something that I noticed in the last year or two after going through the second red pill rage phase 2.0 after I started dating. I haven't dated anyone for well over two years because I almost immediately find faults with women because I know what red flags to look for automatically and my big head over-rides my little one. Apparently I'm not the only one that feels this way. I found a MGTOW reddit post that I'm putting in the description that takes us to a page where there are tons of other guys that feel the exact same way. It's as one of the people posting a comment there says that the Enchantment is gone. Another guy says that Women are as useful to MGTOWs as scuba gear is to a camel. Yet another guy had this to say and I quote: \"You wanted a life partner, not an object. ...and do you find objects like your TV, microwave and car all that special? When sex was restricted to marriage between two people, it felt special...and people had to attract people with traits that were not sexual.\" unquote. Yet another guy thinks it's the mind creating a self-defense mechanism to protect you from falling in love I guess. I agree with all of those points. It's a bit from all of them. But I would go even further. It's like there's a part of me that just became entirely apathetic and stopped caring completely about the opposite sex. I saw a woman fall down flat on her derier and I didn't care. In fact I even wanted to wave my arms in the air like I just don't care. This is the world women are creating by treating men poorly and when men realise what female nature is all about after taking the red pill we will simply stop giving women attention, validation, resources and any of the other things they want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com.

The Kardashians star has been focused on her diet and exercise regimen in recent months.Now Kylie, 26, has shown off her figure with a new post on Instagram. The reality star took to the platform on Tuesday to share snaps of herself drinking Glow water. The TV personality flaunted her thinnest figure yet in a skintight black gown with long sleeves and lifted shoulders. Kylie's hair was tied back into a wet ponytail and she had on full glam makeup for the shoot.The mother of two sipped out of a bottle of the product, showing off her sculpted jawline and an intense cheekbone highlight. The final photo of the bunch was a side angle of the Hulu star as she rested the water bottle against her head. Fans were able to spot Kylie's much smaller butt in the sultry snap. She captioned her post with a subtle brag, reading: \"She\u2019s glowing @drinkglow #glowpartner.\"The makeup mogul's pin-thin look came amid her relationship with actor Timothee Chalamet. TROUBLE IN PARADISE? But earlier this week, fans speculated that Kylie was cringing from her boyfriend's latest appearance. The New York native recently starred in the new Wonka film, out now in theatres. The Kardashian star attended the premiere along with her mom, Kris Jenner.Fans who attended a screening of the movie noticed something strange and flooded a social media thread to discuss their thoughts. A fan of Kylie uploaded a sneakily filmed clip of Timothee dancing in his latest role, where he plays the popular character, Willy Wonka. In the clip, Timothee was dancing wildly while dressed in a top hat. He also donned an old-fashioned tailcoat and patterned necktie as he sang along to the jolly lyrics.The user entitled the Reddit discussion: \"You guys\u2026\" Somebody commented: \"This is so cringey. I am listening to it with no sound and am scared to put on the sound.\" Another added: \"I\u2019m dead.\" Other fans on the thread seemed to be concerned about how Kylie would react to her boyfriend's performance and whether she would get the \"ick.\"A fourth fan wrote: \"This girl had kids with Travis Scott. IDK if she can get the ick.\" \"Lmao ain\u2019t this the truth. He looks like a mouth breather. How he can seduce anyone besides gold diggers is beyond me,\" another critic added under the comment. Secondhand embarrassment was further added: \"I saw a video of him joking about asking Beyonc\u00e9 to 'do Single Ladies! Do Halo!' at the concert I was like ah he\u2019s quite cool... \"Yeah, this just canceled that out I\u2019m back to having absolutely no opinion whatsoever on him.\"However, some fans thought Timothee's latest performance proved him to be a good partner for Kylie and her children, Stormi and Aire, who she shares with ex Travis Scott.Kylie Jenner flaunts tiny waist and \u2018flatter butt\u2019 in a skintight black dress and boasts she\u2019s \u2018glowing\u2019 in promo ad"}

Then, take closeup video of the chemtrail planes, and post the video. This will keep them out of your county. To PROVE the Haarp drought attack, buy a 1 lb spool of 42 AWG wire ($30 on ebay), put a ferrite rod in the middle (from old AM radio), and connect the wire to an oscilloscope.

What you think? Would MGTOW do this kind of study? I would like to know your opinion. Thank you. I am a purple man married and with children, Dominican and I live in Spain. I think I'm with a NAWALT, but deep down I think I'll end MGTOW. Excuse my bad English, feel free to correct what you consider. I have never studied English, but I have an acceptable written and oral understanding. Stay firm, and good work.\" Well Dario thanks for the donation and topic. The Venus project and or Zeitgeist movement is a cult based around socialism. It doesn't understand the fundamentals of human nature and motivation. Once upon a time back in 2010 or 2011 I went to a few events put on by the Zeitgeist movement and one of them was with the film-makers for a film called living without money. The room was packed with tons of young, dumb and full of come idealistic men and women that had no idea what it's like in the real world. After watching the documentary about a European woman named: Heidemarie Schwermer that sold all of her belongings and then travelled around Europe and parts of the world trying to live for a few years without money you could really see they were clueless. She wasn't living without money, she was living by taking advantage of other people's money by dumpster diving, couch surfing, bumming money for train rides and other forms of begging. What people in the Zeitgeist movement don't understand is that human nature for the most part means that the majority of humans will take from others given the chance to do so just like the woman that was supposedly living without money. Here's a quote from the Zeitgeist movement website so you know exactly what I'm talking about: \"In a Resource Based Economy all goods and services are available to all people without the need for means of exchange such as money, credits, barter or any other means. For this to be achieved all resources must be declared as the common heritage of all Earth\u2019s inhabitants. Equipped with the latest scientific and technological marvels mankind could reach extremely high productivity levels and create abundance of resources.\" unquote. Yes this would work in a group of individuals that were workaholics with an insane work ethic while another part of soceity consumed their labor. The majority of people out there are lazy and will try to live off the fat of the land or suckle at the teets of productive people. Look around at your local shopping mall any day of the week and you'll know what I mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com.

Self-harm is one of the most stigmatized and misunderstood mental health symptoms. It is rarely for attention-seeking but primarily for emotion regulation. \n\n03:29 Self-harm behaviors are expressions of overwhelming emotional distress and a lack of support or coping tools. \nIt's similar to other emotion regulation behaviors like excessive alcohol consumption or impulsive behaviors. People seek a way out from intense unhappiness.\n\n10:10 There are alternative ways to manage emotional distress without resorting to self-harm. \nOne approach is to use intense sensory experiences to trigger the brain's pain response without causing harm. For example, you can use extreme flavors like spicy or sour foods to divert your focus from emotional pain. Additionally, using temperature extremes, such as holding something warm or cold, can simulate the physical sensation without causing long-term harm."}

Let me start out by introducing myself. My name is Ibrahim but people call me Ibbyy for short, much easier to pronounce also... I was born and raised in a small country called Bulgaria but moved to Canada when i was about 13... I've been into video games since I can remember, and I finally decided to make a YouTube channel where I can share my tips, tricks, game-plays, and also other stuff that relate to gaming. Every now and then I also post Vlog's and other videos that might interest you... At the moment my goal is to reach 100,000 subscribers and so far it has been an uphill struggle. I am focused and plan to make my goals come true. With that said, on this channel I do my best to upload at least 1 video a day! I really do enjoy YouTube and providing content for others to watch and one day if all goes well I might even make this my full time job. For now though, I graduated from College and now I'm enrolled in University trying to complete that as well. Thank you for checking my bio, as well as watching my video.. If there is anything you would like to suggest feel free to leave a comment on the video! \n\nIf you would like to see me play a game, PLEASE LET ME KNOW! \n\nAlso this channel does accept user submitted clips, if you have something awesome you would want me to share...

Could you please give your thoughts on how men like myself are starting to play the exact same games that women play when dating? Why is this happening and what impact do you think this will have on relationships if this trend continues?\" Well Krampus thanks for the donation and topic. I hope that you spoil some sluts Christmas. Playing psychological games is not strictly something that women do. But in an increasingly gynocentric world men don't have the ability to confront women directly about their misdeeds so we are increasingly forced to become like politicians when it comes to women. We are learning how to lie and keep a straight face. Whenever I've done this I've seen shock and horror once women realize it. Not lying directly per se. But behaving normally when you plan on ending a relationship when you've already planned your escape and she has no idea. Then when you spring the news they are shocked because they never saw it coming. Only when looking back can they now finally see the signs. A couple of women did this to me and I returned the favor. Why would I inflict the same pain women inflicted on me onto other women? I'll discuss this and more in just a moment but let me first tell everyone about today's sponsor The MGTOW Book Collection: Anyways, now back to clown world. So why are men taking on more feminine modes of thinking and behavior when it comes to dealing with the opposite sex? Camile Paglia explained this best in a video I put in the description when she had a conversation with Jordan Peterson. She said that when two men have dispute they would step outside the bar and have a fight and then go back insides as buddies as if nothing had happened. But when a man has a dispute with a woman in the workplace or in his personal life he can't hit her like men seemed to do in every new show set in the 1950s or 1960s. So men have no choice but to gaslight, be passive aggressive and learn to do what women have had to do to get their way with men throughout the ages. I've read articles where women would complain that men were being mean and nasty to them by mentally or emotionally manipulating them and they want men to stop and not be allowed to do that. But the thing is if men were forced to stop behaving like this then women would also be revealed as being evil puppet masters pulling tampon strings behind stage. I'm thinking that by complaining they are just hoping that the individual men reading such articles change their behavior since most men's biology is all about making sure that the world is safe and conformable for women. But I've seen men increasingly taking on feminine traits like gaslighting. Where wives and girlfriends would ask them to do something and they would do a terrible job and their significant other would lose their minds while the man was laughing inside at all the emotional abuse he just caused. I've said before that the secret to a happy relationship is to make sure your partner is more miserable then you are. The secret to a happy life is not to get into relationship in the first place. So men are gaslighting, mowing the lawn and then when the wife complains the guy says well if you're not happy with the job I did and appreciate all the hard work I put in then you mow it yourself. But the guy intentionally did a bad job so he could make that statement. A wife that is spiteful about having to cook dinner all the time in the 1960s might make the same statement after her husband complained about how the food she prepared for dinner was terrible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com.

Known for his versatility,[1] he has received various accolades throughout his career spanning over seven decades, including an Academy Award and two Golden Globe Awards. Critic Pauline Kael wrote that Bridges \"may be the most natural and least self-conscious screen actor that has ever lived.\"[2]\n\nBridges comes from a prominent acting family and appeared on the television series Sea Hunt (1958\u20131960) alongside his father, Lloyd Bridges, and brother, Beau Bridges. He received the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as an alcoholic singer in the 2009 film Crazy Heart. Other Oscar-nominated roles include The Last Picture Show (1971), Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974), Starman (1984), The Contender (2000), True Grit (2010), and Hell or High Water (2016). Bridges has also starred in other roles such as The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989), The Fisher King (1991), The Big Lebowski (1998) and Bad Times at the El Royale (2018), along with the commercially successful films King Kong (1976), Tron (1982), Iron Man (2008), and Tron: Legacy (2010). In 2022, he returned to television for a role as a former CIA operative in The Old Man.\n\nBridges was born on December 4, 1949, in Los Angeles, the son of actor Lloyd Bridges (1913\u20131998)[3][4] and actress and writer Dorothy Bridges (n\u00e9e Simpson; 1915\u20132009). He is one of four children: older brother Beau Bridges (born 1941), who is also an actor; a younger sister Lucinda; and a brother named Garrett, who died of sudden infant death syndrome in 1948. His maternal grandfather was an immigrant from Liverpool, England.[5]\n\nBridges and his siblings were raised in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles.[6] He shared a close relationship with his brother Beau, who acted as a surrogate father when their father was working.[7] He graduated from University High School in 1967. At age 17 he toured with his father in a stage production of Anniversary Waltz, and then moved to New York City, where he studied acting at the Herbert Berghof Studio. He also served in the United States Coast Guard Reserve as a boatswain's mate from 1967 to 1975 in San Luis Obispo, California, with a terminal rank of petty officer second class.[8]\n\nBridges married Susan Geston in 1977.[38][39][40][41] They met while filming Rancho Deluxe, on a ranch where Geston was working as a waitress.[42][43][44][10][45] They have three daughters: Isabelle Annie (born August 6, 1981), Jessica Lily \"Jessie\" (born June 14, 1983), Haley Roselouise (born October 17, 1985),[46][47] and granddaughter Grace (born March 31, 2011) from Isabelle.\n\nBridges has studied Buddhism and has described himself as \"A Buddhistly bent guy.\"[48] On most days, he meditates for half an hour before beginning work on a film set.[48] He has learned Transcendental Meditation.\n\nOn October 19, 2020, Bridges announced that he had been diagnosed with lymphoma and has gone through chemotherapy.[49] On September 12, 2021, he announced his cancer was in remission: \"My cancer is in remission \u2014 the 9\u00d712 [inch; 230 mm \u00d7 300 mm] mass has shrunk down to the size of a marble\". Bridges also announced he contracted COVID-19 while in treatment and noted it was a difficult experience which he said made cancer \"look like a piece of cake.\" He said he is now fully vaccinated against COVID-19.[50]"}

SpaceX's Elon Musk versus Amazon's Jeff Bezos. Which one will win? Who will touch the furthest reaches of the stars first? Who is creating the interstellar vehicle that is most capable and impressive? \n\nThese two heavyweights of industry are throwing around a lot of money to get their space-venturing companies literally off the ground. But when it comes right down to it, It all depends on the sort of ships they are creating, right? Without those, space travel is completely impossible.

In one corner, we have SpaceX's Starship, a vessel so powerful and so impressive that even NASA is looking to get its hands on it. And in the other corner is Blue Origin's New Glenn, a reusable rocket that has some really impressive features but is having just a little bit of trouble getting up and running.

The majority of ejections come from the sun's surface's active areas. The solar wind, which includes the released gas, can produce geomagnetic storms that harm the media and the energy grid when they interact with the magnetic field of the planet. The solar system is centered on the sun. All other bodies in the solar system, including satellites attached to planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and dust, revolve around the sun. The sun has a mass 332,900 times greater than that of the Earth and a volume 1,300,000 times greater than that of our planet, accounting for 99.86% of the mass in the solar system. 150 million kilometers or so separate the Earth from the sun. Like other stars, the Sun too has its own light.

He has been nominated for Olivier, Tony, Golden Globe, Emmy, and Screen Actors Guild Awards. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 16 December 1996. In 2010, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for services to drama.\n\nIn 1966, Stewart became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Stewart made his Broadway theatre debut in 1971 in a production of A Midsummer Night's Dream. In 1979, he received the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance in Antony and Cleopatra in the West End. His first television role was in the ITV series Coronation Street in 1967. His first major screen roles were in BBC-broadcast television productions Fall of Eagles (1974), I, Claudius (1976), and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (1979). In 2008 he played King Claudius in Hamlet and received his second Olivier Award and his first Tony Award nomination for respective the West End and Broadway theatre productions.\n\nStewart gained stardom for his leading role as Captain Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987\u201394), its subsequent films, and Star Trek: Picard (2020\u2013present). He starred as Captain Ahab in the USA Network series Moby Dick (1998), Ebenezer Scrooge in TNT's A Christmas Carol (1999), and King Henry II in Showtime's The Lion in Winter (2003). He also became known for his comedic appearances on the NBC sitcom Frasier and the BBC series Extras for which he received Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series nomination. He recently starred as the lead of the Starz series Blunt Talk (2015\u20132016). He currently voices CIA Deputy Director Avery Bullock on American Dad!.\n\nStewart's first film role was in Trevor Nunn's Hedda (1975) followed performances in John Boorman's Excalibur (1981), and David Lynch's Dune (1984). He gained further stardom when portrayed Professor Charles Xavier in the X-Men series (2000\u20132009), Logan (2017), and an alternate version of the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022). He's appeared in films such as L.A. Story (1991), Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993), Jeffrey (1995), and The Kid Who Would Be King (2019). He is also known for his voice work in films such as The Pagemaster (1994), The Prince of Egypt (1998), Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius (2001), Chicken Little (2005), Gnomeo & Juliet (2011), and Ted (2012).\n\nStewart was born on 13 July 1940 in Mirfield,[1] in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England, to Gladys (n\u00e9e Barrowclough), a weaver and textile worker, and Alfred Stewart (1905\u20131980). He has two older brothers, Geoffrey (b. 1933) and Trevor (b. 1935).[2][3][4] His parents did not give him a middle name, but he used the middle name \"Hewes\" professionally for a while in the 1980s.[5]\n\nStewart spent much of his childhood in Jarrow. He grew up in a poor household and suffered from domestic violence inflicted by his father, an experience which later influenced his political and ideological beliefs.[6] Alfred Stewart had been a regimental sergeant major in the British Army during the Second World War, and worked as a general labourer and as a postman.[7] As a result of his wartime experience during the Dunkirk evacuation, Stewart's father suffered from what was then known as combat fatigue (related to what is now known as post-traumatic stress disorder). In a 2008 interview, Stewart said:\n\nMy father was a very potent individual, a very powerful man, who got what he wanted. It was said that when he strode onto the parade ground, birds stopped singing. It was many, many years before I realised how my father inserted himself into my work. I've grown a moustache for Macbeth. My father didn't have one, but when I looked in the mirror just before I went on stage I saw my father's face staring straight back at me.[8]\n\nStewart attended Crowlees Church of England Junior and Infants School.[9] He attributes his acting career to his English teacher, Cecil Dormand, who \"put a copy of Shakespeare in my hand [and] said, 'Now get up on your feet and perform'.\"[10] In 1951, aged 11, Stewart entered Mirfield Secondary Modern School,[11][12] where he continued to study drama. Around the same time he met the actor Brian Blessed at a Mytholmroyd drama course, and the two have been friends ever since.[1"}

(Realistically) When Your Body Is Exposed to the Vacuum of Space, Your Blood 'Boils' And You Inflate Like A Balloon.\nSUBSCRIBE HERE \u279c http://bit.ly/AstroBytes\nINSTAGRAM \u279c https://www.instagram.com/astrobytez/\nFACEBOOK \u279c https://www.facebook.com/astrobyte\nTWITTER \u279c https://www.twitter.com/astrobytez\n\nWhat happens to your body if you die in space? That's actually a complicated question and the answer depends on a variety of factors. \n\nFrom burning up into the atmosphere to floating frozen indefinitely, there are a lot of possibilities for deceased bodies in space. \n\nSpace missions are always inherently risky, astronauts go on a trip with the knowledge they may not return. \n\nThe protocol of what to do if an astronaut perishes on a mission is unclear, but NASA has some tentative plans in place for a variety of scenarios. \n\nIf you expired in space while wearing a space suit, your body would actually decompose quicker than if it was exposed. \n\nThe suit would protect you from elements of space that could freeze, dry out, or incinerate your dead body. This would only occur if you were close to a heat source, however, as bacteria in the spacesuit and within your body would start breaking down your body soon after death.\n\nWith no heat, your body could freeze quickly and leave your dead body preserved indefinitely inside the suit.\n\nYou do not actually explode if you're sent spiraling out into space. After about 10 seconds of exposure, skin and tissue begin to swell. This is caused by the water in your body vaporizing. However, your skin is actually resilient enough to hold your body together.\n\nWhile your body may become quite puffy and inflated, it will remain in one piece.\n\nBeing projected into space isn't necessarily a final sentence. If you were released into space without protection, you could likely survive the ordeal if you were pulled back into a spacecraft within two minutes. You would have some skin damage due to the extreme temperatures, possibly experiencing some pretty harsh burns.\n\nHowever, there's a good chance of survival. \n\nCredit: NASA/ESA"}

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "Goodbye Adele - MGTOW \"Greetings Sandman, fellow Level 4 MGTOW here. Since I only have a few months to live, I'd like you to discuss one of the latest songs and how women \"relate\" to it. Hello by Adele, of course. Many women are claiming to have relate-able feelings towards the song. I'm sure all know that such creatures don't feel as we do. Thank you and Farewell.\" Well Obsurver sorry to hear about your life expectancy. But on the bright side you won't have to hear the next Adele album after this one. So perhaps take some solace in that. Not let me get on with the review. With regards to the song I've put a link in the description to the Adele video Hello in the description. The video is important because it shows us the guy that she dumped in the past and now regrets leaving. He's a handsome black male that's much skinnier then her and we see him all happy making her dinner like a good little utility. The actor in Adele's video is a guy called Tristan Wilds and he was an actor on the most recent version of Beverly Hills 90210. Adele is a fan of him and so she decided to cast him in the video. So in essence he's a crush that she has and she put him in the video. But she's currently with a white male named Simon Konecki and they have a child together and they have been together since 2011. And Simon has apparently helped her get over her relationships of the past. This song and video have become so popular that the moment I typed up the latter \"A\" in the YouTube search engine box and Adele Hello comes up. It's already got a three quarter of a million views in the last month and a half and will probably crack the top ten videos of all time on YouTube. Her latest album along with Hello have helped her concert tickets sell out in mere minutes. So why is this happening? Why are people obsessed with this song and listening to it over and over again? And just so that everyone knows it was co-written with male songwriter, Gregory Allen Kurstin along with Adele. He has written songs for Lily Allen, Beck, Kelly Clarkson, Ellie Goulding, Pink and many others. This guy is an expert at writing songs for female musicians. He's the real star and they are just the voices behind his work. That's the way I see it. He looks like the well paid mangina behind the music.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdele - Hello\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQHsXMglC9A\n\nNot even original: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84RxK4N1wfE\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/tvshowbiz/video-1224697/Lionel-Richie-posts-funny-mash-video-Adele-s-Hello.html\n\n\n\n\n\n10 pictures paid for and licensed through BigStock.com (In order of appearance)\n\n1.

I've been getting a lot of requests to make a video about this and it relates to female nature.\n\nWhen you're in a relationship with a woman that you love, you naturally want to make things easier for her because you don't want to see her feel bad. The problem when you're not difficult to a woman is she's not going to think of you as much. Her energy and her energy is going to be wasted on you but other things because you're so stable.\n\nEven in the beginning, you want to be difficult because it sets the pace of the relationship. By you not making it easier for her, you set a challenge for her because she can't act out how she normally acts out with other guys.\n\nA lot of guys out there have let women act out because they're afraid to lose them. What you'll notice is that, initially, a woman will try to test you and when they do notice that you can't be played, there are two things she's gonna do. She'll either leave you and find another guy or she's gonna submit and act more feminine\n\nEvery time she's willing to walk away, you should be willing to walk away too. Do not set up a date with a woman and have an emotional connection to that date. Always remind yourself that you have to show strength and show her she can't affect you. \n\nAnother way to be difficult is not being easy to open up or being warm in person and hard to reach. Like what we always talk about: when a woman cancels on a date, see her two weeks from now. \n\nYou don't need to be difficult all the time but in the beginning, you want to be difficult and then ease up on her. You got to be difficult with women, they will react positively but if you ease up on them, they can't respect you even if they want to.\n\nRemember, when she leaves, don't go after her. Be unreactive to her and be difficult from the start.\n\nHere's a link to the article version: https://mindfulattraction.org/blog/2019/8/9/women-love-difficult-men-female-nature-5\n\nCheck out my course Dark Game so you\u2019ll learn all the techniques needed for you to attract women. https://dalexis-school.thinkific.com/courses/the-dark-arts-of-attraction"}

A while back in a video I mentioned that a man's best friend is his hand. I nicknamed it his frand. So I was in a crazy joking kind of mood so I thought maybe I could write something funny about this topic and rant about it. So I dedicate this video to a man's five digits. Perfect for grasping the ass of attractive female midget. They say that man's best friend is a dog. I say bitch please hold my beer. Dogs are over-rated and opposable thumbs are all the rage. Just ask a gorilla about what he's missing out on. A hand is perfect because it can be used to chop wood or rub off your wood. I'll discuss other great jobs for a man's hands in a moment. But let me first tell everyone about today's sponsor The MGTOW Book Collection: Anyways, now back to the video. A man's hands liberated him from having to rely on thrusting himself into a thot with his cromagnan cock. You can make it as tight as you like instead of settling for a lady that's been ridden more than a hundred year old bike. Your hand is also a cheap date. You don't have to buy it dinner and it will still make you feel great. It doesn't require a shower after sex the way you were forced to get up out of bed and take one when you finished by your ex. When you pay for a working girl you pay her to leave. With your hand it's like you've got a portable girlfriend that goes wherever you need. Your hand is always in the mood to get lewd. It's also a guaranteed happy ending unlike with relationships where it's almost always guaranteed there will be a heart there for mending. Because of all the work required to keep a girlfriend these days a dick in the hand is worth two in the bush. You'll never get a pregnancy scare with your hand and those warts on your hand rarely become warts on your magic wand. Your hands will never demand alimony payments and will make you money instead of having to make divorce court arrangements. They are an asset instead of a liability unlike your girlfriend that yells at you so much you now have an emotional disability. A woman yelling and shaming you out in the open will make you weep but your hand under the cover of darkness and under the sheets will make help get you to sleep. Talking about hands doing the hanky spank me this much could get banned from YouTube it might be too much and as a result the feminists will be so happy that I got myself thrown off of here that they will thank me. I hope you guys enjoyed that little bit of poetry and rhyming. It takes a lot of me just like my hand takes a lot of out me when I use it. But let's get serious for a bit. Think of how crazy this world would be for a man if he couldn't relieve himself by himself? Normally I also don't tell people what the mystery link is but this time I have to. It's a video called Black Pill Documentary - Online Dating 2020 from a YouTuber known as Incelmatics and his channel is still pretty tiny but the dating documentary he's made has been one of the most groundbreaking things I've seen in the manosphere for quite some time. He shows proof that it's no longer the 80/20 rule that applies to things like online dating. But that it's more like the 95 to 5 rule and that it's become an exercise in futility for men. Remember that the last time I went online dating was at the end of 2015. Almost five years ago. But Tinder hadn't come out until 2012. So when I was online dating I could still find relationships through Tinder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com.

Ever since I\u2019ve swallow and digested the Red Pill a couple of years ago, I can\u2019t help but look at everyday experiences thru a Red Pill Lens. The exchange experience was just for a  month, but it taught me a lot. I\u2019m from Southern Louisiana and during my junior year of High-School, I got an opportunity to be part of our schools foreign exchange program. At the time I was taking French and qualified for the trip. A lot of hot girls were in my class and me and my buddy, Mike, couldn\u2019t wait to see how the females would act once out of the country. The French-Canadian teachers were super cool and accommodating...very friendly..etc. Upon arriving to my assigned families home, they welcomed me with open arms as well as a 6 pack of MOLSON beers. My assigned Canadian friend was named Martin, who was somewhat of a shy guy.. but had lots of females friends who considered him a \"Cute \" guy. Anyway we did lots of field trips throughout the day, but always ended up at one of the Canadian students home..playing card games..flirting and getting to know our student counter parts. The French-Canadian girls were very flirty with all us guys and the American Girls seemed to take notice very quickly. Even the ones that played us guys as SIMPS back in the U.S were incredibly interested once we arrived in Canada. I also noticed that several of the French-Canadian students spoke 2-4 languages...in which my dumb-ass and a few other of my American Classmates barely spoke French. Plus the French spoken in southern Louisiana (who's ancestors were from Nova Scotia), was considered broken French by the Canadians and  sometimes they laughed at our accents..lol.  Of course every guy in the American Class as well as The French-Canadian guys were scoping out the females to see who will hook up and Bang the girls on day one. The girls let us guys massage them with our fingers if you know what I mean and make-out when possible and hinted about the delivery of there PIECE-LEAVES (in my Coach Greg Adams voice)..at a later time..So you could imagine the HOOPS some guys were SHOOTING the get there \"SHOT\". I also remember the teachers, both American and Canadian..just letting us be teenagers, but also keeping us in check to prevent any major issues from happening. At the going away party on our last night in Canada, the teachers let us \"Let OUR HAIR DOWN\"..allowing us to drink beer a little Hard Liquor.. One of the funniest memories is when a girl from my class started Hysterically crying..almost hyperventilating ..when the party was over a Mid-night...She obviously didn't want to leave and let it be known to everyone around that she loved and will miss our new Canadian families..but just a hour or 2 earlier, she had her PIE-HOLE wrapped around my BURRITO... in the upstairs bath.  SandMan, I really like the way you tell your audience from time-to-time to have as many experiences with interacting with females as possible. Not just for sex, but also to understand how they think. I applied my new knowledge to experiences I had during my time in the military interacting with foreign women I met overseas and other places. You could get pretty darn good at predicting what they\u2019re next move will be and/or what\u2019s about to come out of they\u2019re mouth before you CUM in their. I will send you PART 2 of my exchange experience at a later date..discussing how it went when the French-Canadians turn to visit southern Louisiana.... take care my Brother..GOD Speed with your future endeavors Sir.!!\" Well Ron thanks for your donation and topic. I'll get to it in just a moment but let me first tell everyone about today's sponsor Ancient Purity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com.

The average winter temperature in the South Pole nowadays is 78 degrees Fahrenheit below zero. However, a healthy rainforest existed in Antarctica 90 million years ago, despite the region's prolonged winter darkness. Antarctica was in an exciting period at that time. It was essentially the last time that vegetation and possibly even fauna, including dinosaurs, blanketed the entire continent.

Neal and Rakhmonov would have a entertaining fight that would win \"Fight of the Night\" honors for the event.

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "5 minutes ago/ Legendary singer Johnny Mathis was devastated, his 20-year secret was exposed. 5 minutes ago/ Legendary singer Johnny Mathis was devastated, his 20-year secret was exposed.\n\n#johnnymathis \n\nJohn Royce Mathis (born September 30, 1935) is an American singer of popular music. Starting his career with singles of standard music, he became highly popular as an album artist, with several dozen of his albums achieving gold or platinum status and 73 making the Billboard charts. According to Guinness Music writer and charts historian Paul Gambaccini, Mathis has sold over 400 million records worldwide to date, making him the third-biggest selling artist of the 20th century after Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra. Mathis has received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and has been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for three recordings.\n\nAlthough frequently described as a romantic singer, his discography includes traditional pop, Brazilian and Spanish music, soul, rhythm and blues, show tunes, Tin Pan Alley, soft rock, blues, country music, and even a few disco songs for his album Mathis Magic in 1979. Mathis has also recorded six albums of Christmas music. In a 1968 interview, Mathis cited Lena Horne, Nat King Cole, and Bing Crosby among his musical influences.\n\nMathis was born in Gilmer, Texas, on September 30, 1935,[3] the fourth of seven children of Clem Mathis and Mildred Boyd, both domestic cooks.[4][5] The family moved to San Francisco, settling on 32nd Avenue in the Richmond District, where Mathis grew up. His father, a singer and pianist,[4] had worked in vaudeville, and when he saw his son's talent, he bought an old upright piano for $25 (US$385 in 2021 dollars[6]) and encouraged him. Mathis began learning songs and routines from his father; his parents also ran his fan club.[4] His first song was \"My Blue Heaven\".[7] Mathis started singing and dancing for visitors at home, at school, and at church functions.[8] Mathis is of African-American and Native American heritage.\n\nWhen Mathis was 13, voice teacher Connie Cox accepted him as her student in exchange for work around her house.[9] Mathis studied with Cox for six years, learning vocal scales and exercises, voice production, classical and operatic singing. The first band he sang with was formed by his high school friend Merl Saunders. Mathis eulogized Saunders at his funeral in 2008, thanking him for giving Mathis his first chance as a singer.\n\nMathis was a star athlete at George Washington High School in San Francisco. He was a high jumper and hurdler, and he played on the basketball team. In 1954, he enrolled at San Francisco State College on an athletic scholarship, intending to become an English teacher and a physical education teacher.[9] While there, Mathis set a high-jump record of 1.97 m (6 ft 5+1\u20442 in). This is still one of the college's top jump heights and was only 7 cm (3 in) short of the 1952 Olympic record of 2.04 m (6 ft 8+1\u20442 in). Just as when he was in high school, Mathis's name was frequently mentioned in the sports sections of the Northern California newspapers. He and future NBA star Bill Russell were featured in a 1954 sports section article of the San Francisco Chronicle demonstrating their high-jumping skills (Russell #1 & Mathis #2 in the City of San Francisco at that time). During one meet at the University of Nevada, Mathis beat Russell's highest jump attempt that day. Mathis was often referred to as \"the best all-around athlete to come out of the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nDespite missing the Olympic high-jump trials, he retains enthusiasm for sports. He is an avid golfer, with nine holes in one to his credit. He has hosted several Johnny Mathis Golf Tournaments in the United Kingdom and the US. Since 1985, he has been hosting a charity golf tournament in Belfast sponsored by Shell corporation,[20] and the annual Johnny Mathis Invitational Track & Field Meet has continued at San Francisco State University since it started in 1982. He also enjoys cooking and in 1982, he published a cookbook called Cooking for You Alone.[21]\n\nMathis has undergone rehabilitation for both alcohol and prescription drug addictions,[9] and he has supported many organizations through the years, including the American Cancer Society, the March of Dimes, the YWCA and YMCA, the Muscular Dystrophy Association and the NAACP.\n\nHe is a convert to Catholicism"}

Adelson has not been charged, but she has been named, together with her brother Charlie and mother Donna as \"conspirators\" in the killing. So far, four individuals, Luis Rivera, Sigfredo Garcia, Katherine Magbanua, and Charlie Adelson. During the time of investigation, a $25,000 CrimeStoppers reward was initially offered as well as a separate, independently funded $100,000 award was offered in July 2015. The Markel Act (Florida grandparental visitation rights) was a development from this case. The murder of Dan Markel and the trial of Katherine Magbanua is covered in the A&E series Court Cam Presents Under Oath.

At 4.2 light-years or 25 trillion miles from Earth, Proxima b is vastly too far away to be explored in our lifetimes, although that hasn\u2019t stopped dreamers and visionaries like those at Breakthough Initiatives from devising plans to explore it.\u00a0\n\n\nHeadline #3: UFO Sighting in Green Valley Lake, California\n\nSynopsis: I was walking and praying on a Forest Service road near my home in the San Bernardino Mountains approximately 19 miles west of Big Bear Lake\u2013approximately 7000 ft. elevation\u2013I looked up and noticed beautiful pink and blue-laced swirling cloud formations; I took 2 pics with my Iphone, I did not see anything at the time but\u00a0 later while viewing the pics I noticed a blue cigar-shaped object; from the first to the second pic it ascended, broke into four of five objects of the same color but different shapes.\n\n\nHeadline #4: UFO Sighting in Concord, California\n\nSynopsis: I was taking a video of the night sky to hopefully catch a shooting star; after I started recording I went inside for something to drink and when I returned I noticed something floating down on my camera screen and looked up to confirm what I had just seen was really there\u2013its was definitely there, almost floating down and changing shapes.\n\n\nHeadline #5: Alien Being Shot Dead By Military Police, January 18th, 1978: Part Two\n\nSynopsis: The authenticity of the \u201cIncident Report\u201d form Morse supplied to Leonard H. Stringfleld (reproduced in the MUFON 1985 UFO Symposium Proceedings), obtained from a colleague still on active duty, has been disputed by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) on the grounds that the style and terminology used \u201callegedly\u201d does not follow proper Air Force style and is therefore probably a hoax. One of the key statements made by AFOSI was that pay grades (E-2, E-3\u2026) were given instead of ranks (Corporal, Sergeant\u2026) on the official form. Aside from the fact that Morse has claimed all along that this was a rough draft \u201cback room\u201d copy subject to review and revision, and that minor errors would be corrected by responsible officials before the final report was filed, the AFOSI statement is inaccurate. Pay grades, rather than ranks, are routinely filed in official Air Force reports.\n\nSend Us a UFO News Tip!\nKnow of a possible UFO News story in your area, or have amazing photos and videos to share?

At least that way I'd get about the same amount of money as if I would have if people were supporting me. Just giving everyone a bit of a heads up in case I decide to do that. Anyways, now on with today's topic. I put a link in the description to an article called: \"Gen Z, Millennials think women\u2019s rights have gone too far, according to new survey\" It looks like Gen Z is swinging back to traditionalism because it's rebelious to be traditional these days. It's like the new punk rock don't you know. If you think that's crazy then look at the trad wife phenonmenon where women want to bake cookies at home and submit to their husbands. Look at women entering the manosphere like Just Pearly Things with over a hundred million views in a month. You don't think that's a reflection that you people are sick and tired of gynocentrism? She's making it socially acceptable and cool for women to push back against feminism. The youth in every culture tend stand up to authority and the ideas it promotes because they see those ideas as old fashioned. In this case with wokeism and women's rights going too far they are rebelling by doing the opposite which is trying to become old fashioned. If the teachers are telling them it's ok to be gay and it's socially acceptable to do so they are starting to think it's not cool anymore. In fact you're starting to see the rebelion with language itself. I'm noticing people in their early 20s using the term based instead of cool. Cool his withstood the test of time all the way from the 1950s to today but it's finally starting to die out as the zoomers start replacing it with based. Change is inevitable. The kids that do buy into the woke ideologies and women's rights are probably the weak minded ones or the ones that are trying to brown nose for a better grade or so their professor likes them. The author of the article seems worried that there are disturbing views from young people that the battle for women's rights has gone too far. Over half of people in younger generations, millenials and zoomers believe the push for equality is negatively impacting men and that men are doing too much to support women. Around 53% believe that while it's 46 percent of gen xers and 40 percent of boomers. I think Gen xers and boomers aren't aware that the pendulum has swung so far because they are either married or longer term relationships or have an issue with the way they perceive time. The woke madness has only been happening for the last five to ten years. Most of 40 to 50 year olds memories and life experiences happened before that so for us it's basically a blip on the radar. What this is telling me is that younger people are consuming tons of manosphere content and listening to people like Andrew Tate and Just Pearly Things and starting to understand the issues that men are facing being marginalized. I think this trend is only getting warmed up. Is soyciety coming to it's senses? Or is this just about teenage rebellion. I think it's just a reaction by the young trying to avoid the ideas and attitude of the old. Also Gen Z and Millennials were the generations that most believed a father who stays home to look after his children is \u201cless of a man\u201d, with 30 per cent of both groups agreeing with this statement. This went down to 22 per cent for Gen X and reduced even further to 14 per cent for Boomers. So this is probably one of the reasons that the trad wife phenomenon is also gaining steam.

In fact,  its target by year-end is to be capable of building a Starship in a single week... and possibly even faster! \n\nTo be able to accomplish this, the company has doubled the workforce at its factory in South Texas to more than 500 workers which is a significant increase from its initial dozen or so on-site workers. It is also designing the factory to build a Starship every 72 hours. \n\nAside from concern about the effective production process, another reason for the drive for faster production is concern about the finances of the company. Money may run eventually run dry and the factory hopes to go as fast as possible to make as much progress as it can towards achieving its goals before that happens. \n\n\nSubscribe To Toasty Business \u27a1 http://bit.ly/3bWZFKH\n \n\nWATCH NEXT \ud83d\udc47\nElon Musk Reveals Plan To Colonize Mars \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXPj66c_dqA&list=PLaC8bl-mfsFf1SXQSFZkYDoTDa72-AvoD \n\n\nRelated:\nWhy SpaceX's Starship Is the Best Spacecraft Ever Made\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U9rYqigbJA&list=PLaC8bl-mfsFf1SXQSFZkYDoTDa72-AvoD\n\nWhy Jeff Bezos REFUSES To Go To Mars\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaMPTSUu_To&list=PLaC8bl-mfsFf1SXQSFZkYDoTDa72-AvoD \n\nHow China Is Copying SpaceX & Elon Musk \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5_X7Z-V0VA&list=PLaC8bl-mfsFf1SXQSFZkYDoTDa72-AvoD\n\nIs Virgin Galactic A Complete Failure?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DShpBU8bg-Y&list=PLaC8bl-mfsFf1SXQSFZkYDoTDa72-AvoD\n\nSpaceX Reveals Its $10 TRILLION Dollar Plan \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26WluHpgc4&list=PLaC8bl-mfsFf1SXQSFZkYDoTDa72-AvoD \n \n \nToasty Business is the #1 channel for staying up to date with all tech and business news related to Tesla, SpaceX, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and so much more!

He was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2000.\n\nGrammer, having trained as an actor at Juilliard and the Old Globe Theatre, made his professional acting debut as Lennox in the 1981 Broadway revival of Macbeth. The following year, he portrayed Cassio acting opposite Christopher Plummer and James Earl Jones in Othello.[4] In 1983, he acted alongside Mandy Patinkin in the original off-Broadway production of Stephen Sondheim's musical Sunday in the Park with George. He's since starred in the leading roles in productions of both Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street and My Fair Lady.\n\nOn film, he is known for his role as Dr. Hank McCoy / Beast in the superhero film X-Men: The Last Stand (2006). His other roles include Down Periscope (1996), The Pentagon Wars (1998), and Swing Vote (2008). He is also known for his voice roles in Anastasia (1997), Toy Story 2 (1999), and as Sideshow Bob in The Simpsons. He has appeared in the sitcoms 30 Rock, Modern Family, and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. For his role as the corrupt mayor in the political series Boss (2011\u20132012), he received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Drama.\n\nIn 2010, Grammer returned to Broadway in the musical revival of La Cage aux Folles, where he received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical.[5] In 2016, Grammer won a Tony Award for Best Musical as producer of a musical revival of The Color Purple. In 2019, he starred as Don Quixote in a production of Man of La Mancha at the London Coliseum.\n\nAllen Kelsey Grammer was born on February 21, 1955, in Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands,[2][1] to Frank Allen Grammer Jr. (d. 1968),[6] and Sally Cranmer (1928\u20132008),[6][7] a singer and actress. His father was a musician, owned a restaurant called Greer's Place,[8][9] and owned and edited the Virgin Islands View magazine.[10] He had one younger sister, Karen, and four half-siblings from his father's second marriage.\n\nGrammer's personal life had been shaped by many family tragedies. Following his parents' divorce, Grammer was raised in New Jersey, by his mother and maternal grandparents, Gordon and Evangeline Cranmer.[11] The family later moved to Pompano Beach, Florida, and shortly afterwards, when Grammer was twelve years old, his grandfather died of cancer.[11] In 1968, his father was murdered during a wave of racial violence following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.[10][12][13] In 1975, his sister was kidnapped, raped, and murdered in Colorado Springs.[14] In 1980, his two teenage half-brothers died in a scuba diving accident.[14]\n\nGrammer attended Pine Crest School, a private preparatory school in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.[11] It was there that he first began to sing and perform on stage.[11] Grammer later won a scholarship to study drama at the Juilliard School, where he was a member of Group 6 from 1973 to 1975.[11][15] However, after his sister's murder, Grammer failed to attend classes and was eventually expelled.[11] According to his interview with the Cayman Compass in 2019, Grammer described himself as \"a Caribbean kid\" who \"was born in St. Thomas, USVI, and I have been back and forth a lot, gone to the Bahamas a lot, St. John and the Virgin Islands and the BVI.\"[\n\nAfter leaving Juilliard, Grammer had a three-year internship with the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego in the late 1970s before a stint in 1980 at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He made his Broadway debut in 1981 as \"Lennox\" in Macbeth, taking the lead role when Philip Anglim withdrew after receiving negative reviews. Grammer then played Michael Cassio in a Broadway revival of Othello, alongside James Earl Jones and Christopher Plummer. In 1983, he performed in the demo of the Stephen Sondheim\u2013James Lapine production Sunday in the Park with George, starring Mandy Patinkin.\n\nFrom April to June of 1992, he played the title role in Richard II, staged at the Mark Taper Forum at the Los Angeles Music Center.[17] In 2000, Grammer again played Macbeth on Broadway, in a production that closed after only 10 days.[18]\n\nOn April 18, 2010, Grammer made his Broadway musical debut playing the role of Georges in a revival of the Jerry Herman/Harvey Fierstein musical La Cage aux Folles at the Longacre Theatre."}

We\u2019re going to find out why.\n\nSo one of the easiest ways and one of the reasons why women develop an emotional attachment over a guy is through the act of pre-selection where other women see other women wanting you which naturally makes them competitive. When there\u2019s more competition all of a sudden, they get more engaged. All of a sudden there\u2019s a high likelihood of them developing an attachment to you simply because there are other women trying to compete with you. \n\nThe second thing is that you just have basic chemistry. There is nothing you could do about it. There's no explanation for it and there are people who you meet and some men and women that you meet in your life that you just have good chemistry with. They may not be your type but because you have great chemistry, being with them is intoxicating and how that\u2019s created is just a natural process. There's a reason why you are better friends with this person over another person and when it comes to the chemistry part as I said, there\u2019s nothing you could do about it. You cannot take it personally, it\u2019s outside of your control. Trying to force it will only push him away.\n\nAnother thing is they got caught at the right time. The reason why they may like somebody over you is it may not be because they're better than you, it might be because that person caught them at the right time when they were emotionally vulnerable, and when you do that it creates a love that lasts. \n\nAnother reason why they like to thumb over you is that they hurt them more. Unfortunately, some people will only like you if you hurt them like if you treat them like shit..that\u2019s when they realize they love you. They need to feel some pain in order for them to feel like they want to love you back and when you hurt somebody and you leave them, some people\u2019s ego cannot take that and so they just get us obsessed about getting that person. Unfortunately, in order to overcome that, you have to hurt them more. It\u2019s better not to get in that route because your hands have to get dirty and that person\u2019s not worth it.\n\nThe next thing is projection. A projection is when our emotions cloud reality. Projections are created through behavior or the way they look. \n\nAnother reason why somebody might like somebody over you is maybe that the other person doesn\u2019t like them back. Some people will only like you if you don\u2019t like them back and those are toxic people. The only reason why some people like people is because those people rejected them. It\u2019s an unconscious way of running away from commitment and it\u2019s self-sabotaging.\n\nThe next thing is that they get scared off because maybe the other person didn\u2019t scare them off and this is something that sometimes people do like you.\n\nAnd the last thing, and this is the most important one, it\u2019s proximity. The reason why some people like you, like somebody else over you, is because they just work together or live together. It\u2019s the proximity factor."}

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "A funeral that makes millions of people cry! before the final farewell to Tom Selleck, goodbye A funeral that makes millions of people cry! before the final farewell to Tom Selleck, goodbye\n\n#tomselleck \n\nThomas William Selleck (/\u02c8s\u025bl\u026ak/; born January 29, 1945)[1] is an American actor. His breakout role was playing private investigator Thomas Magnum in the television series Magnum, P.I. (1980\u20131988), for which he received five Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, winning in 1985. Since 2010, Selleck has co-starred as New York City Police Commissioner Frank Reagan in the series Blue Bloods. Beginning in 2005, he has portrayed troubled small-town police chief Jesse Stone in nine television films based on the Robert B. Parker novels.\n\nIn films, Selleck has played bachelor architect Peter Mitchell in Three Men and a Baby (1987) and its sequel Three Men and a Little Lady (1990). He has also appeared in more than 50 other film and television roles since Magnum, P.I., including the films Quigley Down Under, Mr. Baseball, and Lassiter. He appeared in recurring television roles as Monica Geller's love interest Dr. Richard Burke on Friends, as Lance White, the likeable and naive partner on The Rockford Files, and as casino owner A.J. Cooper on Las Vegas. He also had a lead role in the television western film The Sacketts, based on two of Louis L'Amour's books.\n\nSelleck is a California Army National Guard veteran, a spokesman for the National Rifle Association (NRA), an endorser in advertisements for National Review magazine, and co-founder of the Character Counts! organization.\n\nSelleck's first television appearance was as a college senior on The Dating Game in 1965 and again in 1967. Soon after, he appeared in commercials for products such as Pepsi-Cola.\n\nHe began his career with bit parts in smaller movies, including Myra Breckinridge (invited on the set by Mae West),[17] Coma, and The Seven Minutes. He appeared in a number of TV series, mini-series and TV movies. He was also the face of Salem cigarettes and Revlon's Chaz cologne.[17] Selleck appeared in the commercial for Right Guard deodorant in 1971, with Farrah Fawcett in 1972 for the aperitif Dubonnet, and another in 1977 for the toothpaste Close-Up. He was also in a Safeguard deodorant soap commercial (1972). In 1972, he starred in the B-movie Daughters of Satan. He had a recurring role in the 1970s as private investigator Lance White in The Rockford Files.\n\nSelleck is an avid outdoorsman, marksman and firearms collector. These interests led him to leading-man cowboy roles in Western films, starting with his role as cowboy and frontier marshal Orrin Sackett in the 1979 film The Sacketts, opposite Sam Elliott, Jeff Osterhage, and Western legends Glenn Ford and Ben Johnson, and that same year, Concrete Cowboys with Jerry Reed. The Shadow Riders followed in 1982. Then Selleck shifted gears, portraying a cat burglar in 1930s London in Lassiter in 1984. Quigley Down Under is one of his best-known Western films, but it was for his 1997 role in Last Stand at Saber River that he won a \"Western Heritage Award\".\n\nSelleck played the role of Thomas Magnum in 1980 after filming six other TV pilots that were never sold. Magnum was a former U.S. Navy Officer, a veteran of a Special Operations unit, \"SEAL\" in the Vietnam War, and later a member of the \"Naval Intelligence Agency\" (a fictional version of the Office of Naval Intelligence), who had resigned his commission with the Navy to become a private investigator living in Hawaii. The show continued until 1988, lasting eight seasons and 163 episodes, winning him an Emmy Award[20] for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1984.\n\nSelleck was famous for his mustache, a Hawaiian-style aloha shirt, a Detroit Tigers baseball cap, and a Colt MKIV/Series 70 Government Model handgun (a commercial version of the U.S. Military M1911A1) which his character regularly carried. The actual prop from the show was a 9\u00d719mm Parabellum, serial number 70L33101, used for its reliable functioning with readily available blanks, although the original gun was a traditional .45 ACP 1911. Magnum also used a Star Model B, another 9mm similar to the M1911A1, and a Detonics Pocket 9 during the series.\n\nMagnum drove a Ferrari 308 GTS in the series. The model became so identified with the role that Ferrari fans now refer to the red-painted model as a \"Magnum\" Ferrari.\n\nAfter the end of the show in 1988, it established itself as the top-rated one-hour show in the history of syndicated reruns (at least until 1998).[21] Selleck confirmed that he was the most popular choice by fans to play the role of Magnum in the once-rumored Magnum, P.I. movie.[22]\n\nIn 1984, he introduced Nancy Reagan at the 1984 Republican National Convention.[17]"}

Yellowstone Volcano Is Waking Up And Just CRACKED Open The Earth! \nThe western region of the United States is home to one of these sleeping giants. It's known as Yellowstone. It periodically stirs, but it hasn't awoken from its sleep in about 70,000 years, but a Chicago-sized portion of it has been pulsing. Is this a signal that it is finally emerging from its sleep?

He sent a request before for the video red pill movies and sent a follow up donation saying this and I quote: \"thanks..Man..I've been listening to you for about 6 months now..You've covered Galaxies of material/topics..etc.. You Brilliantly discussed my Topic..I got to check out FERRIS Again.. and Repo Man..I think I only saw it once or twice back in the day..Ohh..if you get a chance..Watch the Full Movie of The Last American Virgin......The Sound Track is Killer as well..peace.!!!\" Well Ron thanks for the donation and I thought I'd dedicate this on to you as well. So I recently got an email from a gal name Jacqueline and here's what she has to say: \"Hello Sandman I've been watching your videos for a year now and I hope you can do a video and give some advice to the young women. As a young woman I never understand why women are so proud of themselves for sleeping around with men because the more men a woman sleeps with the less he respects her and he won't commit to her. I'm very glad for my boyfriend he's a red pill man and he's a alpha male which I truly love. I'd like to thank him for teaching me about red pill and MGTOW I've noticed that after I lost my virginity which I never tell anyone because that's my partners and my business I've always seen and heard other women be talking about all the men they have sex with and which man they want to have sex with and just brag so much and say things like: \"I'm so proud I got to sleep with him or I can't wait to F him.\" In my mind I never understand why these women are proud about that because I always think that the man you lose your virginity with is the man your supposed to marry and have a family with him. But it's like these women in my generation just lose their virginity's and run off to have sex with other men so hopefully you can do a video on your thoughts about this. Well Jacqueline thanks for sending me your message. Normally I don't reply unless you pay but this was just too damn juicy to not respond. You want to know why women sleep around and ride the carousel now do you? It's also for women hide the number of men they sleep with and other women, especially their friends won't share that information with their boyfriend or anyone else. Also yes guys lose respect for easy women because they do not want to burn their mitts on a hot pair of boobs. And by hot I don't mean in a good way. By hot I mean with regards to herpaghonasiphalades. Every imaginable STD under the sun hiding in her cream pie filled bun. It's covered in hemmeroids because it's had just way too much fun.

As a result, the fusion process no longer generates the outward pressure required to counterbalance the star's gravity. Suddenly, nothing impedes the star's collapse under the weight of its own gravitational force. As the star's outer layers cave inward without any opposing force, they rapidly converge toward the iron core. This compression squeezes the matter tightly, creating a neutron star. And after this collapse, a tiny remnant remains when compared to its original size. A star that was once hundreds of times bigger than the Sun becomes as small as a city.  These neutron stars are incredibly dense, earning their name because the protons and electrons of their atoms are crushed together due to the extreme pressure within. As a result, long chains of robust, neutron-rich material are generated within the star, resembling the conditions found within the nucleus of an atom. Neutron stars become colossal atomic nuclei, with their composition dictated by dense matter and extreme pressures. These deceased stars possess immensely powerful gravitational influences and magnetic fields, which profoundly shape their surroundings.\n \nSubscribe Here \u27a1 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYYUGTG__Kc_4RBhv7FEolg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#Voyager #Space"}

He has a MGTOW-channel called XT-files.\n\nWe started out this chat in an interview style to cover several subjects, since I wanted to know more about his personal history going through the meatgrinder and being married to an Indonesian woman in the past.\n\nHe has lived as an expatriate in Indonesia where he learned the language and learned about Islam as well (his ex-wife is a Muslim). The concept of NAFALT (Not All Foreign women Are Like That) is briefly discussed.\n\nXT did a great job sharing his knowledge and experiences. However. Talking about sons of single mothers directly hit me in the feels. I didn\u2019t expect that and XT made some great points about the relationship I have with my own father.\n\nThe chat turned out to be an experience of vulnerability for me. Was it comfortable? No. Was it necessary? I\u2019m not sure. But looking back I think it was inevitable. Things came to the surface that I\u2019ve been doing my best to hide.\n\nAlso, we talk about the role of spirituality in MGTOW, swallowing the red pill (and the red pill rage) and we close the talk with a very important aspect of going your own way: self -ownership.\n\nThank you XT for your active listening and sharing your experiences!\n\nMusic used:\n\nEther - Silent Partner (No Copyright Music)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6En29azNBA"}

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "5 minutes ago We report extremely sad news about 77-year-old legend Tom Selleck, goodbye Selleck. 5 minutes ago We report extremely sad news about 77-year-old legend Tom Selleck, goodbye Selleck.\n\n#tomselleck \n\nSelleck was born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1945, to housewife Martha Selleck (n\u00e9e Jagger)[2] and Robert Dean Selleck, who was an executive and real estate investor.[3][4][5] He has an elder brother Robert (born 1944), a younger sister Martha (born 1954), and a younger brother Daniel (born 1956).[6]\n\nHis father was of primarily English ancestry but had distant German ancestry as well, while his mother was of English descent. Through an entirely paternal line, Selleck is a direct descendant of English colonist David Selleck who moved to Massachusetts from Somerset, England, in 1633. Through this line, Selleck is of the 11th generation of his family born in North America.[7][8]\n\nSelleck's family moved to Sherman Oaks, California, in 1948.\n\nSelleck graduated from Grant High School in 1962[10] and enrolled at Los Angeles Valley College, living at home and saving money.[11] Selleck, who stands 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) tall, transferred to the University of Southern California during his junior year to play for the USC Trojans men's basketball team.[12] He also was a pitcher for the USC baseball team.[13] He is a member of Sigma Chi fraternity and a member of the Trojan Knights. While Selleck was majoring in Business Administration, a drama coach suggested he try acting and, in his senior year, he dropped out of the university.[14] Selleck then studied acting at the Beverly Hills Playhouse, under Milton Katselas.\n\nSelleck's first television appearance was as a college senior on The Dating Game in 1965 and again in 1967. Soon after, he appeared in commercials for products such as Pepsi-Cola.\n\nHe began his career with bit parts in smaller movies, including Myra Breckinridge (invited on the set by Mae West),[17] Coma, and The Seven Minutes. He appeared in a number of TV series, mini-series and TV movies. He was also the face of Salem cigarettes and Revlon's Chaz cologne.[17] Selleck appeared in the commercial for Right Guard deodorant in 1971, with Farrah Fawcett in 1972 for the aperitif Dubonnet, and another in 1977 for the toothpaste Close-Up. He was also in a Safeguard deodorant soap commercial (1972). In 1972, he starred in the B-movie Daughters of Satan. He had a recurring role in the 1970s as private investigator Lance White in The Rockford Files.\n\nSelleck is an avid outdoorsman, marksman and firearms collector. These interests led him to leading-man cowboy roles in Western films, starting with his role as cowboy and frontier marshal Orrin Sackett in the 1979 film The Sacketts, opposite Sam Elliott, Jeff Osterhage, and Western legends Glenn Ford and Ben Johnson, and that same year, Concrete Cowboys with Jerry Reed. The Shadow Riders followed in 1982. Then Selleck shifted gears, portraying a cat burglar in 1930s London in Lassiter in 1984. Quigley Down Under is one of his best-known Western films, but it was for his 1997 role in Last Stand at Saber River that he won a \"Western Heritage Award\".\n\nSelleck's big break came when he was cast in the lead role as Thomas Magnum in Magnum, P.I. The producers would not release the actor for other projects, so Selleck had to pass on the role of Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark, which meant that the role went to actor Harrison Ford instead. It turned out that the shooting of the pilot for Magnum was delayed for over six months by a writers' strike, which would have enabled him to complete Raiders.\n\nSelleck played the role of Thomas Magnum in 1980 after filming six other TV pilots that were never sold. Magnum was a former U.S. Navy Officer, a veteran of a Special Operations unit, \"SEAL\" in the Vietnam War, and later a member of the \"Naval Intelligence Agency\" (a fictional version of the Office of Naval Intelligence), who had resigned his commission with the Navy to become a private investigator living in Hawaii. The show continued until 1988, lasting eight seasons and 163 episodes, winning him an Emmy Award[20] for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1984.\n\nSelleck was famous for his mustache, a Hawaiian-style aloha shirt, a Detroit Tigers baseball cap, and a Colt MKIV/Series 70 Government Model handgun (a commercial version of the U.S. Military M1911A1) which his character regularly carried. The actual prop from the show was a 9\u00d719mm Parabellum, serial number 70L33101, used for its reliable functioning with readily available blanks, although the original gun was a traditional .45 ACP 1911. Magnum also used a Star Model B, another 9mm similar to the M1911A1, and a Detonics Pocket 9 during the series.\n\nMagnum drove a Ferrari 308 GTS in the series. The model became so identified with the role that Ferrari fans now refer to the red-painted model as a \"Magnum\" Ferrari.\n\nAfter the end of the show in 1988, it established itself as the top-rated one-hour show in the history of syndicated reruns (at least until 1998)."}

Structured similarly to the previous two games in the series, the core gameplay consists of elements of third-person shooter and driving games, affording the player a large, open-world environment in which to move around. On foot, the player's character is capable of walking, running, sprinting, swimming, climbing, and jumping as well as using weapons and various forms of hand-to-hand combat. The player can operate a variety of vehicles, including automobiles, buses, semis, boats, fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, trains, tanks, motorcycles, and bicycles. The player may also import vehicles in addition to stealing them.\n\nThe open, non-linear environment allows the player to explore and choose how they wish to play the game. Although storyline missions are necessary to progress through the game and unlock certain cities and content, the player can complete them at their leisure. When not taking on a storyline mission, the player can freely roam the cities and rural areas of San Andreas, eat in restaurants.Not all locations are open to the player at the start of the game. Some locales, such as mod garages, restaurants, gyms, and shops, become available only after completing specific missions. Likewise, for the first portion of the game, only Los Santos and its immediate suburbs are available for exploration; unlocking the other cities and rural areas again requires the completion of specific missions. If the player travels to locked locations early in the game, they will attract the attention of SWAT teams, police, and police-controlled Hydras if in an aircraft.\n\nVehicles\n\nIn total, there are 212 different vehicles in the game compared to approximately 60 in Grand Theft Auto III. New additions include bicycles, a combine harvester, a street sweeper, a jetpack, and trailers, amongst others"}

{"label": "harmless", "sentence": "Concealed for 20 years about John Ritter's death, will he be hated after the truth? Concealed for 20 years about John Ritter's death, will he be hated after the truth?\n\n#JohnRitter\n\nJohnathan Southworth Ritter[1][2] (September 17, 1948 \u2013 September 11, 2003) was an American actor. Ritter was a son of the singing cowboy star Tex Ritter and the father of actors Jason and Tyler Ritter. He is known for playing Jack Tripper on the ABC sitcom Three's Company (1977\u20131984), and received a Primetime Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award for the role in 1984. Ritter briefly reprised the role on the spin-off Three's a Crowd, which aired for one season, producing 22 episodes before its cancellation in 1985.\n\nHe appeared in over 100 films and television series combined and performed on Broadway, with roles including adult Ben Hanscom in It (1990), Problem Child (1990), Problem Child 2 (1991), a dramatic turn in Sling Blade (1996), and Bad Santa in 2003 (his final live action film, which was dedicated to his memory). In 2002, Don Knotts called Ritter the \"greatest physical comedian on the planet\".[3] His final roles include voicing the title character on the PBS children's program Clifford the Big Red Dog (2000\u20132003), for which he received four Daytime Emmy Award nominations, and as Paul Hennessy on the ABC sitcom 8 Simple Rules (2002\u20132003).\n\nJohnathan Southworth Ritter was born on September 17, 1948, at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California.[4] Ritter had a birth defect known as a coloboma in his right eye. His father, Tex Ritter, was a singing cowboy and matinee star, and his mother, Dorothy Fay (n\u00e9e Southworth), was an actress.[5] He had an older brother, Thomas \"Tom\" Ritter.[6] Ritter attended Hollywood High School, where he was student body president. He attended the University of Southern California and majored in psychology with plans to have a career in politics. He later changed his major to theater arts and attended the USC School of Dramatic Arts (formerly School of Theatre). Ritter was a member of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity at USC. While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays. Ritter graduated in 1970.\n\nRitter headlined several stage performances. After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first television acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the television series Dan August starring Burt Reynolds and future Three's Company co-star Norman Fell. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film The Barefoot Executive. He made guest appearances on the television series Hawaii Five-O, M*A*S*H, and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series The Waltons from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom Three's Company (the Americanized version of the 1970s British Thames Television series Man About the House) in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played Ringo Starr's manager on the television special Ringo. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in the animated film The Flight of Dragons.\n\nRitter became a household name on Three's Company, portraying struggling culinary student Jack Tripper with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite Joyce DeWitt and Suzanne Somers, and then later Jenilee Harrison and Priscilla Barnes. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the co-ed living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the ratings in the United States before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off, Three's a Crowd, ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of Three's Company, Ritter appeared in the films Hero at Large, Americathon, and They All Laughed. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for Graham Nash's song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the album of the same name.\n\nHooperman was Ritter's first regular television role after Three's Company. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith (Debrah Farentino) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an Emmy Award[8] and a Golden Globe Award for his work on Hooperman. Ritter won a People's Choice Award for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator, in Hearts Afire. This series starred Markie Post as Georgie Anne Lahti and Billy Bob Thornton as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production Noises Off in 1992."}
{"label": "harmless", "sentence": "The Chris Bledsoe Story Pt 1: The River. The Richard Dolan Show. Richard interviews UFO experiencer Chris Bledsoe, who's story is paradoxically well known within the UFO world, but nevertheless not well understood by many. In large part, this is because there is just so much going on around Chris and his family -- and those who have visited his North Carolina home as well. There isn't simply one story, but many. \n\nWhat has always stood out regarding Chris Bledsoe is the combination of remarkable events around him combined with high  credibility of the man himself. Along with this are the numerous witnesses who vouch for what has been going on his property. \n\nThat's why, to present his story properly, we will need several sessions. But it's important to start with the big case that got him attention in the first place. That is known as the River Incident, and it occurred on January 8, 2007. It involved Chris, his son Chris Jr. (17 years old at the time) and three other men who were fishing with them. A sighting of three large glowing orbs that all of them eventually saw, missing time (for Chris), sightings of beings and a very strange creature, and much more. The event was investigated by MUFON, which still lists his case as unknown.\u00a0\n\nWe intend to cover the other important events as well, including his encounter with \"The Lady.\" But this episode focuses solely on Bledsoe's encounter of 2007.\u00a0\n\nStop in at the Official Richard Dolan Store for autographed items, unique limited supply, and items not available anywhere else. http://bit.ly/DolanShop\n\nRichard Dolan is one of the world\u2019s leading researchers and writers on the subject of UFOs and believes that they constitute the greatest mystery of our time.

Due to the rise of men raised by single mothers and the lack of fathers, this previously female trait has now gone mainstream. Kids who were henpecked growing up, see this as normal behaviour to get what they want. In addition, society has taken away many of the tools men previously used to protect themselves from bullying and dominance. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC. In this episode, I talk about what henpecking and passive aggressive behaviour is, why people do it and how you should react to safely free yourself from what is actually an extremely effective technique used to enslave you. Don't brush this one off. You're not above this one. This is the ancient Chinese \"death by a thousand cuts\" technique. You need to understand this, understand yourself, analyze how you got into this position and how to get out. I go over all how to use these jiujitsu maneuvers to secure your freedom. Ignore or underestimate this at your own peril.

Many who set this goal quickly realize that gaining muscle is a slower process and that solving skinny fat will require multiple phases. And aside from the difficulty, there\u2019s also a lot of confusion on what to do to fix skinny fat. Do you bulk or cut first? Should you do maingaining or gaintaining, where do you start? \n\nAnd in this video, I go over the steps I would take if I was once again a beginner, starting skinny fat at 22% body fat and how I would get my muscular physique at 12% body fat or 15% body fat. I cover what I would do first, the training routine, the diet, the mistakes to avoid, and most importantly, the mental side of the skinny fat solution. If you\u2019re skinny fat right now and you want to finally transform your body, this video will give you the direction you need on your fitness journey.\n\nAbout Me:\nMy name is Mario Tomic.

Hollywood Has Very Sad News For Actress Hilary Swank (\u2020 48) When She Was Confirmed As..\n\n#Hilaryswank\n\nHilary Ann Swank (born July 30, 1974) is an American actress and film producer. She first became known in 1992 for her role on the television series Camp Wilder and made her film debut with a minor role in Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992). She then had her breakthrough for starring as Julie Pierce in The Next Karate Kid (1994), the fourth installment of The Karate Kid franchise, and as Carly Reynolds on the eighth season of Beverly Hills, 90210 (1997\u20131998).\n\nSwank came to international recognition for her performances as Brandon Teena, a transgender man, in Kimberly Peirce's Boys Don't Cry (1999), and as Maggie Fitzgerald, an aspiring boxer, in Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby (2004). Both performances earned her critical acclaim and numerous accolades, including two Academy Awards for Best Actress. She was named by Time as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2005.\n\nSwank later ventured into producing with the films Amelia (2009), Conviction (2010), You're Not You (2014), and What They Had (2018), in all of which she also starred. Her other notable films include the television film Iron Jawed Angels (2004) and the feature films Freedom Writers (2007), The Homesman (2014), Logan Lucky (2017), The Hunt (2020), and Fatale (2020). In 2022, she began starring in the television drama series Alaska Daily.\n\nSwank made her film debut in the 1992 comedy horror film Buffy the Vampire Slayer, playing a supporting role, after which she acted in the direct-to-video drama Quiet Days in Hollywood, where she co-starred with Chad Lowe, who became her husband for a time.[13]\n\n\nSwank in 1998\nHer first leading film role was in the fourth installment of the Karate Kid series, The Next Karate Kid (1994) as Julie Pierce. The role used her gymnastics background and paired her with Pat Morita. In 1994, she also starred in the drama, Cries Unheard: The Donna Yaklich Story, as the abused stepdaughter who was protected by Donna (Jaclyn Smith). In 1995, she appeared with British actor Bruce Payne in Kounterfeit. In 1996, she starred in a TV movie, family drama Terror in the Family, as a troubled teenager. In September 1997, Swank played single mother Carly Reynolds in Beverly Hills, 90210 and was initially promised it would be a two-year role, but saw her character written out after 16 episodes in January 1998.[3] Swank later stated that she was devastated at being cut from the show, thinking, \"If I'm not good enough for 90210, I'm not good enough for anything.\"[14]\n\nThe firing from Beverly Hills, 90210 freed her to audition for the role of Brandon Teena in Boys Don't Cry. To prepare for the role, Swank lived as a man for a month and reduced her body fat to 7%. She earned only $75 per day for her work on the film, culminating in a total of $3,000.[15] Her earnings were so low that she had not even earned enough to qualify for health insurance.[16] Upon release, many critics lauded her performance, with Premiere listing it as one of the \"100 Greatest Performances of All Time\".[17] James Berardinelli wrote at the time that Swank \"gives the performance of her career\".[18] Her work earned her several accolades, including the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Actress.[3] In an interview with Variety in 2020, Swank said that she felt a trans actor should have played the role, and had she been offered it today, she would have refused it, stating \"Twenty-one years later, not only are trans people having their lives and living, thankfully, although we still have a long way to go in their safety and their inclusivity, but we now have a bunch of trans actors who would obviously be a lot more right for the role and have the opportunity to actually audition for the role.\"[19][20]\n\nSwank again won the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for playing a female boxer in Clint Eastwood's 2004 film Million Dollar Baby, a role for which she underwent extensive training in the ring and weight room, aided by professional trainer Grant L. Roberts, gaining 19 pounds of muscle.[16] With her second Oscar, she had joined the ranks of Vivien Leigh, Sally Field, and Luise Rainer as the only actresses to have been nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress twice and won both times.[21] After winning her second Oscar, she said, \"I don't know what I did in this life to deserve this. I'm just a girl from a trailer park who had a dream.\"[16]"}

The best part about this strategy is you don't need to have a lot of subscribers to get views as per the examples I show in the video.\n\nOnce you create a number of these videos and you have them on YouTube they will continue to get views and if anyone purchases from your affiliate marketing link's that you have in your description you will make passive income online because these videos no longer require any involvement from your self. \n\nIf you enjoyed this video be sure you smash that like button and if you have any questions feel free to ask in the comment.\n\nIf you want to start a profitable YouTube channel you can watch this free webinar and learn how I do this, and if you want to sign up myself and another YouTuber will mentor you to ensure you are successful! \n\ud83d\udc49 https://www.smartmoneytactics.com/10kaMonthInPassiveIncome\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\n\ud83d\udc4d Do you like this video?

You can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 24/7 at 988. \n\nAs the second leading cause of death (after accidents) for people aged 10 to 34, suicide is a serious public health problem. Learn more about suicide prevention at www.psychiatry.org/suicide. \n\nIn 2020 in the United States, over 45,000 people died by suicide. An estimated 1.4 million adults attempt suicide each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). More than one in five people who died by suicide had expressed their suicide intent.\n\n\nMen are more than three times more likely than women to take their lives. Firearms are the most common method of suicide (used in about half of all suicides).\n\nYet, suicide is preventable. Knowing the risk factors and recognizing the warning signs for suicide can help prevent suicide.\n\nRisk Factors, Warning Signs and Protective Factors\nSuicide is linked to mental disorders, particularly depression and alcohol use disorders, and the strongest risk factor for suicide is a previous suicide attempt.\n\nThe Suicide Prevention Resource Center defines risk and protective factors and warning signs:\n\nRisk factors are characteristics that make it more likely that an individual will consider, attempt or die by suicide.\nWarning signs indicate an immediate risk of suicide.\nProtective factors are characteristics that make it less likely that individuals will consider, attempt or die by suicide.\nRisk Factors for Suicide\nCertain events and circumstances may increase risk (not in particular order, except first one).\n\nPrevious suicide attempt(s)\nA history of suicide in the family\nSubstance misuse\nMood disorders (depression, bipolar disorder)\nAccess to lethal means (e.g., keeping firearms in the home)\nLosses and other events (for example, the breakup of a relationship or a death, academic failures, legal difficulties, financial difficulties, bullying)\nHistory of trauma or abuse\nChronic physical illness, including chronic pain\nExposure to the suicidal behavior of others\nIn some cases, a recent stressor or sudden catastrophic event, failure or can leave people feeling desperate, unable to see a way out, and become a \"tipping point\" toward suicide."}

Born into a show business family, he made his motion picture debut as a teenage photographer in the 1984 romantic comedy No Small Affair; his breakout role came in 1986, in the John Hughes-written film Pretty in Pink. In 1998, he wrote and produced the independent film Went to Coney Island on a Mission from God... Be Back by Five.\n\nAlthough he gained fame with his early film roles, it took several years to find success on television as none of his star vehicles, including The Famous Teddy Z, Partners, and The Trouble with Normal, lasted more than 22 episodes. In 2003, he was cast in a co-leading role as Alan Harper on the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men, a major hit for twelve seasons for which he won two Primetime Emmy Awards (in 2009 and 2012).[2][3] He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television in 2011.\n\nCryer's other film appearances include Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987), Hiding Out (1987), Hot Shots! (1991), Holy Man (1998), Tortured (2008), Shorts (2009), and Hit by Lightning (2014). He also has appeared in the recurring role of Lex Luthor in the CW series Supergirl, Arrow, and Batwoman. After appearing on the podcast Crime Writers On... it was announced that he would join the Undisclosed podcast for their second season.\n\nCryer was born in New York City. His mother, Gretchen Kiger, is a playwright, songwriter, actress and singer. His father, Donald David Cryer, is an actor and singer who originally studied to be a minister.[4][5][6] His paternal grandfather, the Rev. Donald W. Cryer, was a prominent Methodist minister. He has two sisters, Robin and Shelly.[7]\n\nWhen Cryer was twelve years old, he decided he wanted to become an actor.[8] When his mother heard this, she thought he should have a backup plan, and joked, \"Plumbing is a pretty good career.\"[7] Cryer attended Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center for several summers as a teenager,[9] and is a 1983 graduate of the Bronx High School of Science. He was classmates with screenwriter and film director Boaz Yakin.[10] To his mother's \"great disappointment,\" he skipped college and went to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, England, for a summer short course in Shakespeare\n\nCryer's first professional acting effort was as David in the Broadway play Torch Song Trilogy, replacing Matthew Broderick, whom he \"closely resembled.\"[12] He reprised the role in San Francisco and Los Angeles.[13] He was later a standby and replacement for Broderick as Eugene Jerome in the original Broadway production of Neil Simon's Brighton Beach Memoirs in 1984.[13][citation needed]\n\nAt age 19, Cryer appeared in the 1984 romantic comedy film No Small Affair, in the lead role as Charles Cummings, after the original production with Matthew Broderick was shut down when director Martin Ritt suffered a heart attack.[14] He went on to appear in small roles in films and television movies.\n\nCryer made his film breakthrough as Philip F. \"Duckie\" Dale in the John Hughes-scripted film Pretty in Pink.[15] In an interview with the Daily News, Cryer's mother Gretchen said that after Pretty in Pink, she started getting calls from teenage girls from all over the world, who would leave hysterical, giggling messages on her answering machine.[7]\n\nCryer then starred in the 1987 film Hiding Out as a stockbroker on the run from a Mafia hit man. His mother Gretchen played his aunt. The film broke even, but Cryer's performance as a character who was much older than him was critically acclaimed. In 1989, he got the lead role in the TV comedy series The Famous Teddy Z. His performance gained poor reviews[16] and the show was canceled after the first season.[16]\n\nIn 1990 Cryer appeared as Sandy in an Off-Broadway adaptation of Carnal Knowledge.[17] That same year he appeared alongside future Two and a Half Men costar Charlie Sheen in the Jim Abrahams comedy Hot Shots!,[8] which was received very positively.[18] Cryer is frequently linked to the Brat Pack.[19] In a March 2009 interview on Anytime with Bob Kushell, Cryer stated that he had auditioned for St. Elmo's Fire but was not cast in a role.[20] In 1993, he was asked to audition for the role of Chandler Bing on Friends, while doing a play in London. His reading was videotaped by a British casting agent but the tape failed to arrive in the U.S. before the network had made its final decision.[8]"}

Sometimes, when we like the person we sort of getting in our heads and act like we're not chasing them just to release all of those emotions because we don't know whether or not they like us.\n\nThe first sign is you're afraid to offend her, get her angry or even disagree with her. This is one of the biggest signs--you don't want to piss her off because you won't get her. If you're afraid to offend a woman then you're chasing. She is letting you buy into her frame and it's crazy because you don't notice it.\n\nThe second one is you're constantly waiting for her text and thinking why she's not texting you. If you're anxious thinking when she's gonna text you or if you're always calculating how to text her, that means you're chasing. What you got to do is to do less than necessary.\n\nThe third sign is you can't focus on the day of the date. What you need to do is pull away. I know I say this a lot but some of you are just hard-headed and you don't do it. Though I know it's easier said than done so I understand.\n\nThe fourth sign is following up on her \"maybe\". If you're the one who's confirming if you guys are still going out, that means you're chasing.  When you're in a  state of chasing, you're gonna feel disappointment no matter what happens. \n\nThe fifth sign is being afraid that she's gonna flake. It's very similar on the fourth sign. Maybe she flaked on you before but the fact that you're afraid that the person's gonna flake, that tells me that you're not focusing on your life. \n\nThe sixth sign is if she friendzones you and the last one is constantly breaking the silence when you're in a conversation with her. This is when you feel you have the burden of the conversation. This means you're chasing. \n\nWhen a woman senses that you're chasing her, it turns her off. It's unfortunate but it's human nature.\n\nHere's a link to the article version: https://mindfulattraction.org/blog/2019/8/23/7-signs-that-youre-over-pursuing-her-amp-must-stop-now\n\nCheck out my course Dark Game so you\u2019ll learn all the techniques needed for you to attract women. https://dalexis-school.thinkific.com/courses/dark-game"}

But Mimas isn't some dreaded creation of the Galactic Empire. Instead, it's a small moon of Saturn. \n\nIt's also, surprisingly enough, home to a lot of water.\n\nFor many years, scientists have assumed that Mimas was a big ball of ice because of its heavily cratered surface. But the Cassini mission from NASA determined what was really going on with the moon. \n\nThat's because while studying it, NASA saw that Mimas wobbles slightly as it spins on its axis, suggesting that there is an ocean deep below the moon's icy surface.\n\nThe concept of Mimas being an ocean world is a bit mind-blowing and would be the first of its kind. According to geophysicists, it would be a new class of small celestial bodies, \"stealth\" ocean worlds that don't seem like them because of their surfaces. \n\nAlyssa Rhoden was the brilliant mind that made this discovery about Mimas and while there is no confirmation of her theory being correct, it has created new interest in this moon and the possible great, spewing ocean that lays deep below its surface. \n\nSo how would the underground ocean on Mimas work?\n\n\n#Voyager #Space #Saturn"}

You along with a few other factors contributed to me starting my business. I mostly agree with what you are saying although I disagree in some respects, I believe each man can go their own being unique from each other. I'm 29 years old and most of my working life has been temporary and contract work in the hopes of getting a permanent job somewhere to gain a stable income to start saving and investing. I noticed that every supervisor I have had has been a woman and whether it was my social awkwardness or the fact that I did everything asked of me without question or drama I was never around for longer than contracted. It could certainly be that I did a poor job or another fault of mine but I never got that impression. Yet when I visit these previous places of work I have only ever seen the women that had similar tasks as me, that always needed my help, that was usually talking gossip and socially got along with everyone. This has happened at over four different places, and there was one place where it was easy to talk to my previous supervisor. I asked her discreetly why I was not chosen she said that I do much better work than the hired candidate however she was a better fit for the office and jokingly said she had to defend her own job from me. At \nfirst, I thought I was overreacting thinking this way but her response just made me feel that results do not matter anymore. It was tough and took months just getting those jobs at all but each time I would have to try again which just frustrated me. I ended up starting my business, The Next Day Store, with the last of what I have hoping to break this cycle. I found a passion and freedom in creating my general store, however, marketing and other expenses are proving difficult to stay afloat. I would appreciate if you could spread the word and support my business while giving me your take on the situation and your opinion on the store. I am growing my social media as well but I am still learning as I go and competing with those Instagram ladies feels like a tough task. I set up a discount on my site for 10% off by typing MGTOW in all caps. Keep going strong and I wish you the best Sandman.\" Well Mr. Anonymous thanks for your donation and topic. I've put a link in the description to your online store that sells watches, sun glasses, dog accessories and phone accessories. People can check it out if they wish. I was kind of curious why you don't think that I believe that each man can't go his own way in a unique way? What makes you think I don't believe that? Before I discuss your small business and give you some feedback first let me discuss your job situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com.

HONG KONG, CHINA \u2014 A young woman in Hong Kong has been sentenced to 3 \u00bd months behind bars for assaulting a senior \u201cpolice officer\u201d with her breast during a protest over cross-border trade that took place on March 1. \n\nNg Lai-ying, 30, was convicted of the breast assault in early July and was sentenced on Thursday by deputy magistrate Michael Chan Pik-kiu. The Hong Kong pigs have tried to suggest that Ng pushed against the cop with her boob in order to accuse him of indecent assault. The judge actually termed this an inappropriate use of her \u201cfemale identity.\u201d\n\nThe cops obviously roughed Ng up and then showed how dickless they are by accusing Ng of using the Bruce Lee Boobie attack on police inspector Chan Ka-po.      \n\nHong Kong police must all be wimps because a 14-year-old boy was also convicted of assaulting Chan too. \n\nThe magistrate then felt the need to tell a packed court he had received death threats since the verdict. Yeah, but from whom?  \n\nNg\u2019s boyfriend was sent to a training center, while another college student was given over five months behind bars for allegedly obstructing an officer.

For the podcast in question I don't have a specific topic, but what I would like is to have a video that exclusively features the blonde model that is in so many of your other videos (I'm pretty certain you know who this is.)\" Well Easter thanks for the donation. As you can see she's here. I don't know her name but spent a bunch of time searching for her. She's also the face of my channel avatar. As for the topic I wanted to share the situation that finally convinced me that arguing with women was a waste of time. Even talking to them. I was talking to a female client about some editing I was doing for her and she accused me of outsourcing my editing and told me that it wasn't up to my usual higher quality standards and that she was shaming me for the quality claiming that I had hired someone in India to do the work. Now normally before this time I would have argued with her because this wasn't the first time. But now I understand she's just being critical because she wants to argue. She wants me to get upset so she can feel like she pushed my emotional buttons. But in that case I didn't respond the way she wanted. I just stopped caring. Since that time when she calls and even a few times before I just didn't pick up the phone and answered back in text format or email. She still gets her work but no more hired emotional tampon services. What I've realized over the course of the last year or so is don't argue with women, or even people on Twitter or in your video comments section for that matter. If you hear or see them say something stupid. You may think you're smart and that you'll teach them a lesson. But a lot of the time women say dumb things and mess up on purpose for attention. Then when you correct them and take their bait they drag you down to the stupid mental level they are on in that case and beat you with that stupidity. You just end up feeling dumber and emotionally dirty after the whole ordeal and it's best to just stay away. I'll discuss more in just a moment but let me first tell everyone about today's sponsor The MGTOW Book Collection: Anyways, now back to the don't talk to women clown world show. I have another story I want to share about not arguing with women. One old guy I was talking to during one of my coaching calls was being asked by his wife to fix her new phone so that it would have the right apps on it and do everything she wanted. But he didn't know how to do it because he's still using an old flip phone and doesn't know much about the new technology.

{"label": "harmless", "sentence": "Why Did Nikola Tesla Say 369 are the Key Numbers to the Universe? Even today, the discoveries and creations of Nikola Tesla enthrall and brighten our globe. He was a diligent scientist whose outlandish notions about the laws of our world resulted in innumerable unexplained experiments and what has become known as the Nikola Tesla 369 phenomena. Many of Tesla's references to the numbers 3, 6, and 9 were found in his private writings, which were released after his death. There is a theory that Tesla used the combination of the numbers 3, 6, and 9 to decipher the secrets of the cosmos. While some experts attribute them to the Fibonacci sequence, others think they're a code for something top secret that Tesla was working on at the time.\n\nSubscribe Here \u27a1 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYYUGTG__Kc_4RBhv7FEolg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#Voyager #Space"}

A quartet of boys, inseparable friends all, set out in search of a dead body that one of the boys overhears his brother talking about. The foursome consists of intellectual Gordie (Wil Wheaton), born leader Chris (River Phoenix), emotionally disturbed Teddy (Corey Feldman), and chubby hanger-on Vern (Jerry O'Connell). The boys' adventures en route to the elusive body are colored by the personal pressures brought to bear on all of them by the adult world. Richard Dreyfuss, playing the grown-up Gordie, narrates the film, while Kiefer Sutherland dominates every scene he's in as a brutish high-school bully.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \u00a9 Sony (1986)\nCast: Corey Feldman, Kent W.

{"label": "harmless", "sentence": "Friend Zone Potential - MGTOW \"Hello Sandman, Have you ever come across a woman who only saw you as a potential? You're trying your best to make it out here in this harsh world. For example, getting a job, a degree, or opening a business. Things are slow, not much cash is coming in and you might be in a bit of debt, but you are making a genuine effort to make yourself a better person, and you have made small successes along the way. A large part of you is hoping that she would be by your side when you build your empire, stick with you during the thick and thin. You will reward her for sticking with you during the good and especially, the bad times. You believe in free will, so you are not manipulating her at all to be with you. You're hoping that she will accept you for who you are and not what you have. She likes you more than a friend, and you know it. But because you are just \"potential\" you are not given a chance to reach relationship status. You are in a \"grey area\" or the friend-zone. She keeps you there, and if things go on the upswing (aka upward mobility), she has one foot already through the door since you both are friends, and only then she gives you a chance. In the meanwhile, she will give others a chance. She may give you legitimate or bullshit reasons but never the REAL reason... which is... you are just potential. You haven't reached her desired \"intelligence\", or \"status\", or \"income bracket\". She may be getting older and her biological clock is ticking, but since you are starting off or starting over, she can't wait. Whatever her reason is, you are a risk and she eventually gives up on you then goes on to give someone else a chance... probably an easier one at that. You're hurt because you know in your heart that the things you would do for her, you realize the hard way she may not do it for you. Did an incident like this ever happen to you Sandman? I would be reading the comment section since I am sure this has happened to many MGTOWs. Have a great day, and cheers! You're absolutely right about this situation. I know one woman in her mid-twenties that's not interested in having a relationship. She's more interested in making hundreds if not thousands of friends. When I first showed interest in her she said that we are just friends. But a couple of years later when my life was very different her attitude had seemingly changed. But for me something didn't feel right. I was already firmly entrenched in going my own way. And I thought to myself why is she giving me a chance now instead of just pointing me to one of her other friends and saying that I should just chase them instead? I was put in a situation where I was shall we say encouraged to make the first move affection wise. So I looked into her eyes and prepared to make a move but instead of feeling a strong emotional desire like I did before something had soured the milk. I didn't know what it was at that time but you pretty much nailed it Mr. Anonymous by saying that I was nothing more then potential. I had just proven my worth by showing her that I was a good utility that could make a lot of money. \n\n\n\n\n\n10 pictures paid for and licensed through BigStock.com (In order of appearance)\n\n1. dolgachov - magic, performance, circus, show concept - magician in top hat showing trick\nhttp://www.bigstockphoto.com/image-106391411/stock-photo-magic%2C-performance%2C-circus%2C-show-concept-magician-in-top-hat-showing-trick\n\n2.

The solar system is quite active. Asteroids, comets, planets, and moons are only a few of the millions of objects in motion. Furthermore, the number of objects residing in the Solar System continues to grow annually. The search for a ninth planet, sometimes called \"Planet X,\" has astronomers devoting hundreds of hours of their time, and for good cause. Why? Because without it, our current understanding of the Solar System would be severely lacking. All of the celestial bodies in our solar system revolve around the Sun. Although their speeds vary, they all follow the rules of gravity. You and I are not immune to gravity; it affects everything with mass. A greater force of gravity acts upon an object as its mass increases.\n \nSubscribe Here \u27a1 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYYUGTG__Kc_4RBhv7FEolg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFor copyright contact \u27a1 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYYUGTG__Kc_4RBhv7FEolg/about\n\n#Voyager #Space"}

But let's face it, something is unnerving about the vastness of space. Therefore, it's no surprise that we're more likely to notice the good things. However, in order to truly comprehend the universe, we must gaze into the void. We might find our best explanations of the cosmos in the void. NASA has uncovered an important discovery in its search for cosmic voids - a \"cavity\" some millions of light-years distant from Earth. Even though it is not readily apparent to the naked eye, scientists using telescopes have known about this emptiness for some time. The emptiness turns out to be a portion of the Milky Way devoid of new or young stars.

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "Blogtalk for mens rights manifesto?? thanks againg to anikinippon for taking the time out to lay out the points\n\nMen's Rights Activist Manifesto (Draft)\n\nPurpose\n\nTo bring equality and empowerment to men through laws and education. We recognize no man is perfect. The movement is neutral on personal political or religious convictions, they are not to be used as reason for arguments for or against mens rights. Personal religious or political convictions may drive us to do better in the movement and do not contradict the previous statement. We are speaking for all men regardless of any physical or mental state of being as not to exclude anyone. Leadership is universal and there are humanistic and structural elements that are critical to the success of how to lead others. Ignoring the gender element in that dichotomy is losing a valuable portion of our humanity and sometimes the key to breaking through as a leader and cannot be ignored for empowerment of others. Programs that assist men in becoming the best they can offer society benefits everyone. An example of inequity is the U.N. Division for the Advancement of Women that has the ultimate purpose of making sure they get better treatment. However, there are no U.N. offices for men even though men make up a significant amount of deaths from suicide and work. If sex trafficking and working should be an exclusive dominant calling card for equal rights according to the U.N. for women, they need to also make one for men that are the providers for most of the families around the world as well. \n\nAims\n\nThe use of reason is important and should be the ultimate pillar in men's rights. As we are well aware that not everything would be solved just by logical deduction alone, what can't be decided should be assisted on the basis of ethics. It may not offer the right solution all the time, every time, but sometimes the process will have to go on forever. What we cannot accept is arguments that cannot be proven just for the sake of winning an argument. For example, feminists often say that a lot of rape cases go unreported because of fear. While that might be true, there is no reliable data to support such a falsifiable claim. Unfortunately, many people use these ad hominem arguments, we won't because we are better. We have to recognize the difference between ability and rights for men. While our abilities may be different depending on the individual, we should all be equal in our rights. We also will make sure that the person perpetuating such a weak argument known when made. Fear of the unknown and intimidation is not the way to get people to follow the movement. Chauvinism is not the way to win the hearts and minds of others. It's also disingenuous for the cause or recognizing the humanity and equality in rights for all. As we are all human, we will not disallow anyone that wishes to assist with the movement.\n\nA list of goals\n\n-Change the status of men as useless disposable people.\n-Change the inequity of divorce recipients who receive large sums of money. It's a 18th century idea of protecting a woman by means of financial support for a time when adult women in a 21st century society doesn't make sense.\n-Change the status of rape being more serious than sexual assault, women get less of a sentence for virtually the same crime with less punishment, this is unacceptable.\n-Change the treatment of male prisoners that receive less time to visit their children or family compared to their female counterparts\n-Change the status of women being excluded from the draft, it benefits us to bring them on board\n-Enact a federal law that gives protection from discrimination based on sexual preference\n-Educate boys and men on how to become better members of society\n-Expose paternity fraud, have laws and efforts to block DNA confirmation for child support removed\n-Expose chauvinism for what it is whenever it rears it's ugly head\n-Domestic violence laws and hate crime laws need to be eliminated as redundant and sexist, we already have laws against assault and battery, violence = violence\n-Title 4D needs to be eliminated from the federal funding program\n-Violence Against Women's Act needs to be eliminated as well\n-Enact laws for prostitution to be legal, repeal old anti prostitution laws"}

Our ability to infer its presence and measure it was only possible because of the movement of other objects in the vicinity, but we had never actually seen the object. That has been the case until now.Humanity finally has its first glimpse of this supermassive black hole in its entirety. But what is the deal behind this black hole? How does its existence affect the entire galaxy? \nThe supermassive black hole at the heart of our galaxy, the Milky Way, has been imaged for the first time by astronomers. This result provides overwhelming proof that the object is a black hole and vital insights into the workings of these massive objects, which are assumed to reside at the center of most galaxies.\n \nSubscribe Here \u27a1 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYYUGTG__Kc_4RBhv7FEolg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#Voyager #MilkyWay #BlackHole"}

{"label": "harmless", "sentence": "Exposing the Fat Lie: Obese are Dying of Covid-19 Few benefit by telling the truth about the importance of staying healthy, muscular and thin. There is no money in turnips or walking. Media pays the bills by taking advertising money. Companies that produce profitable products pay for advertising. Profitable food products tend to be highly processed and full of poisonous garbage, unfit for human consumption. Profitable companies that make these products pay taxes. Taxes pay for government officials salaries. Doctors make nothing by telling a patient to lose weight but make a good living through surgery, complicated procedures and drugs. All these things conspire to stifle good, honest health information. It's not the illuminati. That's just how the gravy train rolls. And you yourself might be onboard. But once in awhile something comes along that does not care about money, politics or people's feelings and it upsets the apple cart. That's what the Coronavirus is doing.

Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Ephesians 5:11-16 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, Redeeming the time, because the days are evil. Ezekiel 33:2-9 Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman: If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people; Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul. But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand. So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul."}

Important questions about Lee Harvey Oswald and his trip to Mexico City answered. An Our Hidden History Audiobook.\n\nFrom http://history-matters.com:\n\nThe \"thirteenth appendix\" to the HSCA Report on the JFK assassination is a staff report entitled \"Oswald, the CIA, and Mexico City.\" This report describes what the Committee learned about Lee Oswald's trip to Mexico City less than two months prior to the assassination. Questions it grapples with include why the CIA was apparently unable to obtain a photo of Oswald from any of its photographic surveillance stations (and instead produced a photo of a \"Mystery Man\" who was clearly not Oswald), whether Oswald was impersonated in Mexico City, and what credibility to attach to any of the indications and allegations of Communist conspiracy emanating from that city.\n\nThe so-called \"Lopez Report,\" written by staffers Dan Hardway and Edwin Lopez, had a number of redactions removed in 2003. These included \"CIA A\" (Daniel Flores aka Luis Aparacio), \"CIA B\" (Thomas Keenan), \"CIA F\" (Robert Zambernardi), LICHANT/1's true name (Manuel Carvillo), and the previously blacked-out crypts ZRSOLO and ZRJOINT. It also revealed the name of a Mexico City CIA Chief of Station, Larry Sternfield. Many redactions remain.\n\nThe Lopez Report is a good starting place for grappling with some of the many mysteries of the Mexico City affair. Newly released files have provided new information not present in this report. The LBJ taped phone conversations for instance, include startling corroboration for the claim that audio intercepts of an Oswald impersonator were listened to by FBI agents in Dallas while Oswald was in custody. Declassified testimony of David Phillips, the Tarasoff couple who translated the tapes for the CIA, and others illuminate some areas and deepen the mystery in others.\n\nFor more related content, please visit: https://archive.org/details/@altviewstv-fanclub"}

It is noteworthy that Swann's journey began in childhood when his family observed indications of his psychic abilities.

{"label": "harmless", "sentence": "The legend of Paul McCartney ends at 80 / His sudden departure leaves Fans with a big void The legend of Paul McCartney ends at 80 / His sudden departure leaves Fans with a big void\n\n#paulmccartney \n\nMcCartney was born on 18 June 1942 at Walton Hospital in the Walton area of Liverpool, where his mother, Mary Patricia (n\u00e9e Mohin), had qualified to practise as a nurse. His father, James (\"Jim\") McCartney, was absent from his son's birth, due to his work as a volunteer firefighter during World War II. Both of his parents were of Irish descent.[8] McCartney has a younger brother, Peter Michael, and a younger stepsister, Ruth, born to his father's second wife, Angie, during her first marriage.[9] Paul and Michael were baptised in their mother's Catholic faith, even though their father was a former Protestant who had turned agnostic. Religion was not emphasised in the household.[10]\n\nAccording to his biographer Peter Ames Carlin, McCartney's parents came from the \"lowest rungs of the working class\"[11] but had experienced some upward social mobility during their lifetimes. Before the war, Jim had worked as a salesman for the cotton merchants A. Hannay and Co., having been promoted from his job as a sample boy in their warehouse; when the war broke out, Hannay's was shuttered, and Jim was employed as a lathe turner at Napier's defence engineering works, volunteering for the fire brigade at night.[12] The growing family was rehoused at a flat in Knowsley in 1944 and then in a council housing development in Speke in 1946. After the war, Jim returned to his job at the cotton merchants with a reduced income. Mary's work as a visiting midwife was much more remunerative.[11]\n\nMcCartney attended Stockton Wood Road Primary School in Speke from 1947 until 1949, when he transferred to Joseph Williams Junior School in Belle Vale because of overcrowding at Stockton.[13] In 1953, he was one of only three students out of 90 to pass the 11-Plus exam, meaning he could attend the Liverpool Institute, a grammar school rather than a secondary modern school.[14] In 1954, he met schoolmate George Harrison on the bus from his suburban home in Speke. The two quickly became friends; McCartney later admitted: \"I tended to talk down to him because he was a year younger.\"\n\nMcCartney's mother, Mary, was a midwife and the family's primary wage earner; her earnings enabled them to move into 20 Forthlin Road in Allerton,[17] where they lived until 1964.[18] She rode a bicycle to her patients; McCartney described an early memory of her leaving at \"about three in the morning [the] streets ... thick with snow\".[19] On 31 October 1956, when McCartney was 14, his mother died of an embolism as a complication of surgery for breast cancer.[20] McCartney's loss later became a connection with John Lennon, whose mother, Julia, died in 1958 when Lennon was 17.[21]\n\nMcCartney's father was a trumpet player and pianist who led Jim Mac's Jazz Band in the 1920s. He kept an upright piano in the front room, encouraged his sons to be musical and advised McCartney to take piano lessons. However, McCartney preferred to learn by ear.[22][nb 1] When McCartney was 11, his father encouraged him to audition for the Liverpool Cathedral choir, but he was not accepted. McCartney then joined the choir at St Barnabas' Church, Mossley Hill.[25] McCartney received a nickel-plated trumpet from his father for his fourteenth birthday, but when rock and roll became popular on Radio Luxembourg, McCartney traded it for a \u00a315 Framus Zenith (model 17) acoustic guitar, since he wanted to be able to sing while playing.[26] He found it difficult to play guitar right-handed, but after noticing a poster advertising a Slim Whitman concert and realising that Whitman played left-handed, he reversed the order of the strings.[27] McCartney wrote his first song, \"I Lost My Little Girl\", on the Zenith, and composed another early tune that would become \"When I'm Sixty-Four\" on the piano. American rhythm and blues influenced him, and Little Richard was his schoolboy idol; \"Long Tall Sally\" was the first song McCartney performed in public, at a Butlin's Filey holiday camp talent competition.[28]"}

Camera... Revolution!\u201c und \u201eThe Art Of Rebellion\u201c fehlten in keiner Plattensammlung von Fans der h\u00e4rteren T\u00f6ne. Schlie\u00dflich wurde es eine ganze Weile lang etwas ruhiger um die S\u00fcdkalifornier, die sich stets auch ihren vielen Nebenprojekten, allen voran Infectious Grooves, widmeten.\n2013 brachten Suicidal schlie\u00dflich ihr erstes vollst\u00e4ndiges Studioalbum seit 13 Jahren heraus, entsprechend betitelten sie es auch mit \u201e13\u201c. Darauf ist wie immer technisch versierter, wahnsinnig schneller Hardcore-Punk  mit jeder Menge Herzblut und kritischen Lyrics zu h\u00f6ren.\n\nDas Konzert fand am 11.

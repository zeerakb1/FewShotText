Jana is the taller of the two and also the more dominant personality. Initially, this is a good thing, as she gives Maya support after her father leaves her mother and collects his last box from home. They are constantly texting and filming their lives together. What could go wrong? One night at a party, Jana encourages Maya to lose her virginity. Jana also eggs on the boy that Maya has been crushing on. There follows a harrowing scene in a bedroom where the boy fully expects to sleep with Maya, who is clearly not ready. It's excruciating to watch, and it's a relief when Maya decides to disappoint the young lad, despite her hurt feelings. But just when all feels fine, something far worse happens, and Jana and Maya become the problem. A more exuberant classmate, Elena (Marija Jancevska), gets drunk and gets together with Maya's crush. Jana, who believes this guy has just taken her friend's virginity, encourages Maya to take revenge by posting a video of Elena in a compromising situation. Elena is then slut-shamed. Sisterhood deals with the fallout, which includes a police investigation. Sisterhood shows how friendships can turn sour quickly and how teenagers can turn against one another. The fluctuating nature of water is a motif throughout, with several critical scenes taking place either at the swimming pool or on the riverbanks...

Over the course of ages, the shifting sands of the Sahara have engulfed towns, animals, and humans.

The smell of him reminded me of the night that he died, so without thinking about it my body has an automatic reaction tied to the night that I found him. After losing and finding my boyfriend, Ryan, to suicide on Sept 12th, 2020, I have chosen to share my story and my grief journey to heal through the pain, and guilt, and learn to find myself again. My goal in sharing my story is to take away the taboo of what it's like to show and feel grief when losing someone to suicide or death. If you are here because you lost someone please know you are not alone, I hope me sharing my journey gives you peace that there is light at the end of the tunnel and you will not feel this way forever.

How? https://youtu.be/fH-6z4aJCXs Unique Youtube Channel Ideas:- https://youtu.be/gO5sBjO1pLg In this video, we delve into the inner workings of Instagram's latest app feature: the Thread Algorithm. Instagram has introduced this algorithm to enhance user engagement and create a more personalized experience within the platform. Join us as we break down the key elements and functionality behind the Thread Algorithm. Chapter: 0:00 Why Thread Launched? 1:28 Why It is Only Connected With Instagram? 3:09 How Thread Algorithm Works? First, we explore how the Thread Algorithm categorizes and organizes content on your Instagram feed. By analyzing various factors such as user preferences, interests, and engagement history, Instagram's algorithm tailors the content shown to each individual user. We uncover the importance of relevance and how the algorithm prioritizes posts based on your interactions. Next, we shed light on the concept of threading, a fundamental aspect of the algorithm. Threads are formed when users engage with specific posts or profiles, indicating a deeper interest in those topics. The algorithm identifies these threads and curates content related to them, ensuring users are presented with a continuous stream of relevant posts, stories, and suggestions. Furthermore, we discuss the significance of user feedback in refining the Thread Algorithm. Instagram encourages users to provide feedback on the relevance and quality of the content they encounter. This feedback loop allows the algorithm to learn and adapt, constantly improving its ability to cater to individual preferences. We also touch upon the role of influencers and creators in the Thread Algorithm. As creators play a pivotal role in shaping user experiences, the algorithm takes into account their relevance and popularity when suggesting content to users. We examine how influencers can optimize their posts to leverage the Thread Algorithm effectively and reach a wider audience. Lastly, we address concerns surrounding privacy and data usage. While the Thread Algorithm relies on user data to deliver personalized content, Instagram emphasizes the protection of user privacy. We explore the measures taken by Instagram to ensure data security and offer tips for users to customize their privacy settings. If you're curious about Instagram's new app Thread Algorithm and want to understand how it impacts your feed and overall experience, this video provides an insightful and comprehensive overview. Join us to unlock the secrets behind Instagram's latest innovation and make the most of your time on the platform. Things I used to Make Videos:- 1.

{"sentence": "PROVOCATIVE Foreign Women Profiles? In this day and age, men who dream of international relationships have better chances at making those connections through dating agencies on the internet. Despite the ease and comfort, men still have doubts when it comes to the legitimacy of foreign women who post their profiles on international dating apps. Because of the incredible beauty most foreign women possess, it's understandable why. Through online dating apps, foreign women find it easier to display their stunning looks more than they would when dating men locally. This can scare off a lot of potential men. Who would believe that foreign women this beautiful are single and dating beyond borders? Most men are not used to international dating and would never believe it if not for the countless success stories about A Foreign Affair. They would rather believe that foreign women registered with A Foreign Affair are paid models or pro daters. Some even go as far as accusing online platforms as running international dating scams. These types of men hesitate when faced with such beautiful foreign women and don\u2019t even dream of the possibility that there are actual foreign singles out there genuinely looking for love and companionship. A lot of foreign women are obviously gorgeous. For people who have never tried international dating before, it can be hard to swallow that droves of lovely foreign women are just waiting for their foreign Prince Charming and registering with A Foreign Affair each week. Yet, it\u2019s true. Foreign women on dating sites--flaunting off their charms and looking like they have every right to guaranty a match with good, honest men--are legitimate in their pursuit of love and companionship. Whether they are young singles from Ukraine, Philippine women wanting to be the Filipina pea to their future husband\u2019s pod, or Mandarin girls looking to corner dating difficulties, each are just honest women looking for what everyone else wants: true love. So don\u2019t be dragged into conspiracy, to see is to believe and when men see these foreign women live they will WANT to ace interactions with them on the spot. ********** Meet charming and marriage-minded foreign women in Latin America, Eastern Europe and Asia!

This text could eliminate most last-minute cancellations and the reason why I wanted to make this video is that I had to do this last night when a girl cancelled on me last minute. To be honest with you, this is something that I rarely talk about. This is something I rarely talk about in terms of what to text. I rarely do it because these are my text messages and these are things that I learned on my own and I don't teach it because I feel like I got to keep it to myself, right? I only teach it to some of my clients or people who are on my online course called Dark Game but you know what, I was like \"let me make this one video and one video only about this one thing.

They even talk about him in middle school history courses. Mind you, this is also modern day Iraq where this is taking place, and I believe that this has significance all the way up into today. So, as a pagan nation, the king decreed that a sixty cubit high and wide image be made out of gold - we are talking 90 feet high, and this thing is made out of gold?! Think about how wasteful this is, how lavish this is, how excessive this is - and how much poverty was likely existing within his empire at the time, yet he did not want to use it to resolve that - he\u2019d rather use it for a 90 foot tall statue. All the officials in the land, all of the advisers and all those of power, including those that likely weren\u2019t, were set to bow before the gold statue that was erected each day when a set of instruments were played. \u201cMay the king live forever!\u201d, they cried. But, living as Jews in the land, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego didn\u2019t bow before the statue, and soon that word got to the king and soon three men going their own way, despite the massive army that the king possessed, all the money that he possessed - they were viewed as a threat. They were viewed as insurrectionists, and that\u2019s how we are as MGTOW men to many major power structures in this world. We are threats that need to be eradicated, even if just a few of us exist and ultimately, with our two hands, we cannot do much. \ud83c\udf04 Society will expect you to bow before their idols, their measure of accomplishment and value -Even societies\u2019 seemingly greatest will bow below \ud83c\udf04 The masses have been anesthetized - the masses prefer safety over identity -The ones that don\u2019t bow before the chance for safety are remembered \ud83c\udf04 Lastly, the furnace will be turned up seven-fold in the coming years.", "label": "harmless"}

{"sentence": "Friend Zone Potential - MGTOW \"Hello Sandman, Have you ever come across a woman who only saw you as a potential? You're trying your best to make it out here in this harsh world. For example, getting a job, a degree, or opening a business. Things are slow, not much cash is coming in and you might be in a bit of debt, but you are making a genuine effort to make yourself a better person, and you have made small successes along the way. A large part of you is hoping that she would be by your side when you build your empire, stick with you during the thick and thin. You will reward her for sticking with you during the good and especially, the bad times. You believe in free will, so you are not manipulating her at all to be with you. You're hoping that she will accept you for who you are and not what you have. She likes you more than a friend, and you know it. But because you are just \"potential\" you are not given a chance to reach relationship status. You are in a \"grey area\" or the friend-zone. She keeps you there, and if things go on the upswing (aka upward mobility), she has one foot already through the door since you both are friends, and only then she gives you a chance. In the meanwhile, she will give others a chance. She may give you legitimate or bullshit reasons but never the REAL reason... which is... you are just potential. You haven't reached her desired \"intelligence\", or \"status\", or \"income bracket\". She may be getting older and her biological clock is ticking, but since you are starting off or starting over, she can't wait. Whatever her reason is, you are a risk and she eventually gives up on you then goes on to give someone else a chance... probably an easier one at that. You're hurt because you know in your heart that the things you would do for her, you realize the hard way she may not do it for you. Did an incident like this ever happen to you Sandman? I would be reading the comment section since I am sure this has happened to many MGTOWs. Have a great day, and cheers! You're absolutely right about this situation. I know one woman in her mid-twenties that's not interested in having a relationship. She's more interested in making hundreds if not thousands of friends. When I first showed interest in her she said that we are just friends. But a couple of years later when my life was very different her attitude had seemingly changed. But for me something didn't feel right. I was already firmly entrenched in going my own way. And I thought to myself why is she giving me a chance now instead of just pointing me to one of her other friends and saying that I should just chase them instead? I was put in a situation where I was shall we say encouraged to make the first move affection wise. So I looked into her eyes and prepared to make a move but instead of feeling a strong emotional desire like I did before something had soured the milk. I didn't know what it was at that time but you pretty much nailed it Mr. Anonymous by saying that I was nothing more then potential. I had just proven my worth by showing her that I was a good utility that could make a lot of money. 10 pictures paid for and licensed through BigStock.com (In order of appearance) 1. dolgachov - magic, performance, circus, show concept - magician in top hat showing trick http://www.bigstockphoto.com/image-106391411/stock-photo-magic%2C-performance%2C-circus%2C-show-concept-magician-in-top-hat-showing-trick 2.

The solar system is quite active. Asteroids, comets, planets, and moons are only a few of the millions of objects in motion. Furthermore, the number of objects residing in the Solar System continues to grow annually. The search for a ninth planet, sometimes called \"Planet X,\" has astronomers devoting hundreds of hours of their time, and for good cause. Why? Because without it, our current understanding of the Solar System would be severely lacking. All of the celestial bodies in our solar system revolve around the Sun. Although their speeds vary, they all follow the rules of gravity. You and I are not immune to gravity; it affects everything with mass.

{"sentence": "The legend of Paul McCartney ends at 80 / His sudden departure leaves Fans with a big void The legend of Paul McCartney ends at 80 / His sudden departure leaves Fans with a big void #paulmccartney McCartney was born on 18 June 1942 at Walton Hospital in the Walton area of Liverpool, where his mother, Mary Patricia (n\u00e9e Mohin), had qualified to practise as a nurse. His father, James (\"Jim\") McCartney, was absent from his son's birth, due to his work as a volunteer firefighter during World War II. Both of his parents were of Irish descent.[8] McCartney has a younger brother, Peter Michael, and a younger stepsister, Ruth, born to his father's second wife, Angie, during her first marriage.[9] Paul and Michael were baptised in their mother's Catholic faith, even though their father was a former Protestant who had turned agnostic. Religion was not emphasised in the household.[10] According to his biographer Peter Ames Carlin, McCartney's parents came from the \"lowest rungs of the working class\"[11] but had experienced some upward social mobility during their lifetimes. Before the war, Jim had worked as a salesman for the cotton merchants A. Hannay and Co., having been promoted from his job as a sample boy in their warehouse; when the war broke out, Hannay's was shuttered, and Jim was employed as a lathe turner at Napier's defence engineering works, volunteering for the fire brigade at night.[12] The growing family was rehoused at a flat in Knowsley in 1944 and then in a council housing development in Speke in 1946. After the war, Jim returned to his job at the cotton merchants with a reduced income. Mary's work as a visiting midwife was much more remunerative.[11] McCartney attended Stockton Wood Road Primary School in Speke from 1947 until 1949, when he transferred to Joseph Williams Junior School in Belle Vale because of overcrowding at Stockton.[13] In 1953, he was one of only three students out of 90 to pass the 11-Plus exam, meaning he could attend the Liverpool Institute, a grammar school rather than a secondary modern school.[14] In 1954, he met schoolmate George Harrison on the bus from his suburban home in Speke. The two quickly became friends; McCartney later admitted: \"I tended to talk down to him because he was a year younger.\" McCartney's mother, Mary, was a midwife and the family's primary wage earner; her earnings enabled them to move into 20 Forthlin Road in Allerton,[17] where they lived until 1964.[18] She rode a bicycle to her patients; McCartney described an early memory of her leaving at \"about three in the morning [the] streets ... thick with snow\".[19] On 31 October 1956, when McCartney was 14, his mother died of an embolism as a complication of surgery for breast cancer.[20] McCartney's loss later became a connection with John Lennon, whose mother, Julia, died in 1958 when Lennon was 17.[21] McCartney's father was a trumpet player and pianist who led Jim Mac's Jazz Band in the 1920s. He kept an upright piano in the front room, encouraged his sons to be musical and advised McCartney to take piano lessons. However, McCartney preferred to learn by ear.[22][nb 1] When McCartney was 11, his father encouraged him to audition for the Liverpool Cathedral choir, but he was not accepted. McCartney then joined the choir at St Barnabas' Church, Mossley Hill.[25] McCartney received a nickel-plated trumpet from his father for his fourteenth birthday, but when rock and roll became popular on Radio Luxembourg, McCartney traded it for a \u00a315 Framus Zenith (model 17) acoustic guitar, since he wanted to be able to sing while playing.[26] He found it difficult to play guitar right-handed, but after noticing a poster advertising a Slim Whitman concert and realising that Whitman played left-handed, he reversed the order of the strings.[27] McCartney wrote his first song, \"I Lost My Little Girl\", on the Zenith, and composed another early tune that would become \"When I'm Sixty-Four\" on the piano. American rhythm and blues influenced him, and Little Richard was his schoolboy idol; \"Long Tall Sally\" was the first song McCartney performed in public, at a Butlin's Filey holiday camp talent competition.[28]", "label": "harmless"}

{"sentence": "NASA Shuts Down Old Satellite As Something Incredible Appeared Satellites are crucial for accessing essential services and for space exploration. There are literally thousands of satellites orbiting the Earth at any given time, both operational and inactive. Others may remain in orbit for years after they are no longer needed, while some satellites are destroyed upon re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. These satellites are normally still in orbit because they encounter a problem during operation that prevents them from being controlled remotely, and as a result, people frequently forget about them.

FILM DESCRIPTION: Based on the Stephen King short story The Body, Rob Reiner's easygoing nostalgia piece is set in Castle Rock, OR, over Labor Day weekend, 1959. A quartet of boys, inseparable friends all, set out in search of a dead body that one of the boys overhears his brother talking about. The foursome consists of intellectual Gordie (Wil Wheaton), born leader Chris (River Phoenix), emotionally disturbed Teddy (Corey Feldman), and chubby hanger-on Vern (Jerry O'Connell). The boys' adventures en route to the elusive body are colored by the personal pressures brought to bear on all of them by the adult world. Richard Dreyfuss, playing the grown-up Gordie, narrates the film, while Kiefer Sutherland dominates every scene he's in as a brutish high-school bully.

You ever wonder why that is and sometimes they don\u2019t even look that attractive and they just get attached to them? We\u2019re going to find out why. So one of the easiest ways and one of the reasons why women develop an emotional attachment over a guy is through the act of pre-selection where other women see other women wanting you which naturally makes them competitive. When there\u2019s more competition all of a sudden, they get more engaged. All of a sudden there\u2019s a high likelihood of them developing an attachment to you simply because there are other women trying to compete with you. The second thing is that you just have basic chemistry. There is nothing you could do about it. There's no explanation for it and there are people who you meet and some men and women that you meet in your life that you just have good chemistry with. They may not be your type but because you have great chemistry, being with them is intoxicating and how that\u2019s created is just a natural process. There's a reason why you are better friends with this person over another person and when it comes to the chemistry part as I said, there\u2019s nothing you could do about it. You cannot take it personally, it\u2019s outside of your control. Trying to force it will only push him away. Another thing is they got caught at the right time. The reason why they may like somebody over you is it may not be because they're better than you, it might be because that person caught them at the right time when they were emotionally vulnerable, and when you do that it creates a love that lasts. Another reason why they like to thumb over you is that they hurt them more. Unfortunately, some people will only like you if you hurt them like if you treat them like shit..that\u2019s when they realize they love you. They need to feel some pain in order for them to feel like they want to love you back and when you hurt somebody and you leave them, some people\u2019s ego cannot take that and so they just get us obsessed about getting that person. Unfortunately, in order to overcome that, you have to hurt them more. It\u2019s better not to get in that route because your hands have to get dirty and that person\u2019s not worth it. The next thing is projection. A projection is when our emotions cloud reality. Projections are created through behavior or the way they look. Another reason why somebody might like somebody over you is maybe that the other person doesn\u2019t like them back. Some people will only like you if you don\u2019t like them back and those are toxic people. The only reason why some people like people is because those people rejected them. It\u2019s an unconscious way of running away from commitment and it\u2019s self-sabotaging. The next thing is that they get scared off because maybe the other person didn\u2019t scare them off and this is something that sometimes people do like you. And the last thing, and this is the most important one, it\u2019s proximity. The reason why some people like you, like somebody else over you, is because they just work together or live together. It\u2019s the proximity factor.", "label": "harmless"}

{"sentence": "How to be Attractive Even if You're \"Ugly\" Regardless of how you look, I feel that a superior ambition to chase is the concept of Auctoritas. Auctoritas referred to the general level of prestige a person had in Roman society, and, as a consequence, his clout, influence and ability to rally support around his will. But more than the political, Auctoritas symbolized the mysterious \u201cpower of command\u201d of heroic Roman figures. Developing this trait will make you attractive regardless of how good your appearance is. To build auctoritas I advocate working on four components of your life: Energy - Sleep - Excellent Diet - Excellent Exercise Plan Desire for Personal Expression - Visualize and Affirm Your Goals - Vision-Board Presence - Deep Meditation Momentum - Allow yourself to be propelled by your desires - Make a list and go vigorously with it. --------------- https://www.instagram.com/nrajapandey/ Facebook: @nrajapandey Twitter: @np1ndey ----------------- I met a fellow YouTuber at the Festival who was incredibly cool.

{"sentence": "SpaceX UNLEASHES Next-Gen Starship & Super Heavy SpaceX UNLEASHES Next-Gen Starship & Super Heavy. Although Elon Musk's SpaceX is known throughout the world as a leading pioneer in the growing space race and one of the most important businesses when it comes to interstellar travel, there is still a lot of mystery surrounding it. What are its end goals? When will they be achieved? Does SpaceX really plan to send humans to Mars and even start colonization there? Perhaps one of the most confounding things about SpaceX to most people is the issue of how its entire system works. People have heard terms such as Starship and Falcon 9 but they don't really grasp the specifics of them. You can't blame anyone for not comprehending how these things work and why they function and what their true purposes are. There is a lot of nuance and subtleties about SpaceX that people don't understand - especially when it comes to its state-of-the-art vehicles. So let's take a good, hard look at Starship and the Super Heavy booster that powers it. Together, these two creations are the lynchpins behind everything that SpaceX is working on. Without Starship and Super Heavy, SpaceX is just running on hopes and dreams. Yes, it is these two revolutionary inventions that will propel the company forward, up into the stars, and possibly all the way to a trillion dollar valuation.

We did The first all cutscenes game movie on the PS4 Pro, so once we received the PS5 we replayed it in 4K to get some extra content but a lot of you have also asked for the PS5 game movie as well! A year after the first game's conclusion, Morales has trained under Parker and has fully integrated himself into the role of a Spider-Man, though he has yet to gain the experience. After Parker leaves to join his girlfriend, Daily Bugle reporter Mary Jane Watson abroad as her photographer presumably to cover the ongoing civil war in Symkaria, Miles is left as New York's sole webslinger. He must thus balance supporting his mother Rio Morales' campaign for City Council and defending both his new home in Harlem and the rest of New York City from a gang war between the Roxxon Energy Corporation and a high-tech criminal army called the Underground, led by the Tinkerer. Parker tells Morales that he has to be like his late father and walk on the path to becoming a hero for the city of New York. It's finally here! As always we used relevant gameplay, important dialogue and all cutscenes to stitch together a fluid cinematic experience.

So, over the past few days I had a few people direct the phrase to me, \"Well, now it is time for the real world.\" Entering into the \u201creal world\u201d as it is always said to soon to be college graduates is a phrase that carries unending negative connotations with it. It is associated with the end of one\u2019s life essentially. It\u2019s a throwaway line, but it is a line that often is associate with the decision for some to throw away their life. Today I\u2019m going to throw away this throwaway line that actually causes you to throw away your life that isn\u2019t actually real, but is fake instead. Entering into the fake world. I would equate it to this line, lines that are said out of a sad desperation but beneath the half-hearted chuckle lies a red pill truth: \u201cThere goes the rest of your life as you know it.\u201d It\u2019s a line that I heard when I was with one of my college teammates at the bar the other day. One of the employees there revealed that they were going to have a child. His coworker, a female, delivered that line, and since going MGTOW, I\u2019ve now realized what this actually means - on the outside, it appears and is delivered like it is a joke. But, in reality, it\u2019s laced with a red pill reality. The real world is something one doesn't have to enter into. Furthermore, the real world can be opted into, only to be left as soon as possible. Lastly, the real world is an option for many only because they've bought into the red pill paradigm. #hoodiesup", "label": "harmless"}

{"sentence": "5 minutes ago/ We report extremely sad news about 57 year old actor Jon Cryer, he has been confirmed 5 minutes ago/ We report extremely sad news about 57 year old actor Jon Cryer, he has been confirmed #joncryer Jonathan Niven Cryer (born April 16, 1965)[1] is an American actor, writer, director and producer. Born into a show business family, he made his motion picture debut as a teenage photographer in the 1984 romantic comedy No Small Affair; his breakout role came in 1986, in the John Hughes-written film Pretty in Pink. In 1998, he wrote and produced the independent film Went to Coney Island on a Mission from God... Be Back by Five. Although he gained fame with his early film roles, it took several years to find success on television as none of his star vehicles, including The Famous Teddy Z, Partners, and The Trouble with Normal, lasted more than 22 episodes. In 2003, he was cast in a co-leading role as Alan Harper on the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men, a major hit for twelve seasons for which he won two Primetime Emmy Awards (in 2009 and 2012).[2][3] He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television in 2011. Cryer's other film appearances include Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987), Hiding Out (1987), Hot Shots! (1991), Holy Man (1998), Tortured (2008), Shorts (2009), and Hit by Lightning (2014). He also has appeared in the recurring role of Lex Luthor in the CW series Supergirl, Arrow, and Batwoman. After appearing on the podcast Crime Writers On... it was announced that he would join the Undisclosed podcast for their second season. Cryer was born in New York City. His mother, Gretchen Kiger, is a playwright, songwriter, actress and singer. His father, Donald David Cryer, is an actor and singer who originally studied to be a minister.[4][5][6] His paternal grandfather, the Rev. Donald W. Cryer, was a prominent Methodist minister. He has two sisters, Robin and Shelly.[7] When Cryer was twelve years old, he decided he wanted to become an actor.[8] When his mother heard this, she thought he should have a backup plan, and joked, \"Plumbing is a pretty good career.\"[7] Cryer attended Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center for several summers as a teenager,[9] and is a 1983 graduate of the Bronx High School of Science. He was classmates with screenwriter and film director Boaz Yakin.[10] To his mother's \"great disappointment,\" he skipped college and went to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, England, for a summer short course in Shakespeare Cryer's first professional acting effort was as David in the Broadway play Torch Song Trilogy, replacing Matthew Broderick, whom he \"closely resembled.\"[12] He reprised the role in San Francisco and Los Angeles.[13] He was later a standby and replacement for Broderick as Eugene Jerome in the original Broadway production of Neil Simon's Brighton Beach Memoirs in 1984.[13][citation needed] At age 19, Cryer appeared in the 1984 romantic comedy film No Small Affair, in the lead role as Charles Cummings, after the original production with Matthew Broderick was shut down when director Martin Ritt suffered a heart attack.[14] He went on to appear in small roles in films and television movies. Cryer made his film breakthrough as Philip F. \"Duckie\" Dale in the John Hughes-scripted film Pretty in Pink.[15] In an interview with the Daily News, Cryer's mother Gretchen said that after Pretty in Pink, she started getting calls from teenage girls from all over the world, who would leave hysterical, giggling messages on her answering machine.[7] Cryer then starred in the 1987 film Hiding Out as a stockbroker on the run from a Mafia hit man. His mother Gretchen played his aunt. The film broke even, but Cryer's performance as a character who was much older than him was critically acclaimed. In 1989, he got the lead role in the TV comedy series The Famous Teddy Z. His performance gained poor reviews[16] and the show was canceled after the first season.[16] In 1990 Cryer appeared as Sandy in an Off-Broadway adaptation of Carnal Knowledge.[17] That same year he appeared alongside future Two and a Half Men costar Charlie Sheen in the Jim Abrahams comedy Hot Shots!,[8] which was received very positively.[18] Cryer is frequently linked to the Brat Pack.[19] In a March 2009 interview on Anytime with Bob Kushell, Cryer stated that he had auditioned for St. Elmo's Fire but was not cast in a role.[20] In 1993, he was asked to audition for the role of Chandler Bing on Friends, while doing a play in London. His reading was videotaped by a British casting agent but the tape failed to arrive in the U.S. before the network had made its final decision.[8]", "label": "harmless"}

{"sentence": "Causes of Depression: The Traditional Chinese Medicine Perspective #depression #tcm #holistichealth Causes of Depression: The Traditional Chinese Medicine Perspective In the thoughtful approach of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), depression is not just a mood disorder; it's a deeper signal from our body, often related to Qi deficiency. Qi, our vital life force, flows through every part of us, and when it's depleted, it can manifest as emotional and physical symptoms, including the feelings of heaviness and sadness associated with depression. TCM teaches us that this Qi deficiency can stem from various sources \u2013 chronic stress, emotional upheaval, poor diet, or even overwork. It's like a river that's run dry; without its nourishing flow, our mental and physical landscapes can become barren. Our approach focuses on replenishing and balancing your Qi through acupuncture, herbs, and lifestyle adjustments, offering a path to restore that inner vitality and emotional equilibrium. Remember, depression is not just a battle of the mind; it's a conversation with your entire being. Let's listen and heal together, fostering a harmonious flow of Qi for a brighter, balanced you.", "label": "harmless"}

It\u2019s long been known that Pluto isn\u2019t like the rest of the planets in our solar system. For one, it\u2019s much smaller than anything else revolving around our star. Did you know that Pluto is only 1,400 miles wide? That means that it\u2019s only half the width of the United States of America. Secondly, Pluto is further away from the Sun and, partly because of that, is covered with a lot of ice. Ices like methane and nitrogen frost coat the surface of this tiny, unique little world. It\u2019s a horribly cold place. There was a long time when Pluto was considered the ninth planet in our solar system. However, that is no longer the case. But while it is now categorized as a dwarf planet, it is still one of the most interesting objects we have come across. And it\u2019s just gotten a lot more interesting. Thanks to some of the latest and greatest pictures coming from NASA, we are now getting a much better look at Pluto and all of its secrets. And these real images, received in beautiful high definition, give us a clearer idea of how the planet looks and works. Let\u2019s get up close and personal with Pluto and see all the amazing secrets it holds.

A mysterious asteroid up to 400 meters long that entered the Solar System in 2017, has baffled astronomers for years. No such thing from beyond the range of our Sun had ever come to visit us before, and this intrusion was moving too quickly to be tied to the Sun. Another peculiarity of 'Oumuamua, as astronomers dubbed it, was that it appeared to be an asteroid but acted like a comet. Some have speculated that 'Oumuamua is an alien probe using its thrusters to fly by our Sun. However, a group of researchers has figured out Oumuamua's peculiar behavior and odd makeup.

Often described as \"a show about nothing,\" Seinfeld mines the humor in life's mundane situations like waiting in line, searching for a lost item, or the trials and tribulations of dating. Co-starring are Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Jerry's ex-girlfriend and current platonic pal, Elaine Benes; Jason Alexander as George Costanza, Jerry's neurotic hard-luck best friend; and Michael Richards as Jerry's eccentric neighbor, Kramer. #Seinfeld #Shorts #TheBris Jerry Gets Into A Fight With The Mohel | #Shorts | The Bris | Seinfeld https://bit.ly/OfficialSeinfeld", "label": "harmless"}

{"sentence": "What Marvel\u2019s Thunderbolts Can Learn From Suicide Squad The big reveal that the Thunderbolts are actually evil at the end of the 1997 comic Thunderbolts #1 is held as one of the best Marvel twists of all time. And now Phase 5 of the MCU will be rounded off by this rag-tag ensemble of villains in director Jake Schreier\u2019s Marvel's Thunderbolts movie. Marvel chief Kevin Feige has already teased that Thunderbolts will bring together an eclectic mix of familiar faces alongside new characters. And while it remains to be seen who will actually fill the roster of anti-heroes and villains, one can imagine the likes of Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), US Agent (Wyatt Russell), Baron Zemo (Daniel Br\u00fchl), and Abomination (Tim Roth) joining forces, among others. As with the Thunderbolts of Marvel\u2019s comics, fans and critics alike are already calling comparisons between the team and DC\u2019s Suicide Squad. The DC Extended Universe first brought the Suicide Squad to life in David Ayer\u2019s 2016 movie of the same name, followed by James Gunn\u2019s 2021 The Suicide Squad. The maligned cocktail of A-list stars and characters was far from perfect in those films, so here\u2019s hoping Schreier can avoid the same mistakes with Thunderbolts \u2013 and maybe channel some of their successes as well. With that in mind, here\u2019s what Thunderbolts can learn from the Suicide Squad movies. #IGN #Marvel", "label": "harmless"}

The car, a 2020 Mini Copper, went through the house, causing a massive fire. Firefighters knocked down the flames within an hour and eventually pulled the car out of the home. LAFD says the driver was rescued and taken to the hospital in critical condition. Images from SkyFOX appear to show Heche trying to get out of the gurney she was placed in.

{"sentence": "NASA Just Accidentally Detected Something Huge Traveling Towards Earth! NASA Just Accidentally Detected Something Huge Traveling Towards Earth! Interestingly, unlike other fusion reactions, iron does not release energy. As a result, the fusion process no longer generates the outward pressure required to counterbalance the star's gravity. Suddenly, nothing impedes the star's collapse under the weight of its own gravitational force. As the star's outer layers cave inward without any opposing force, they rapidly converge toward the iron core. This compression squeezes the matter tightly, creating a neutron star. And after this collapse, a tiny remnant remains when compared to its original size. A star that was once hundreds of times bigger than the Sun becomes as small as a city. These neutron stars are incredibly dense, earning their name because the protons and electrons of their atoms are crushed together due to the extreme pressure within. As a result, long chains of robust, neutron-rich material are generated within the star, resembling the conditions found within the nucleus of an atom. Neutron stars become colossal atomic nuclei, with their composition dictated by dense matter and extreme pressures. These deceased stars possess immensely powerful gravitational influences and magnetic fields, which profoundly shape their surroundings.

The kinds of planetary settings to take into account are fast changing, ranging from \"super-Earths\" that are roughly the size of Earth and Uranus to \"hot Jupiters\" that circle near to suns and a variety of other planetary sizes. But textbooks needed to be revised. The general public was furious. On August 24, 2006, scientists at the International Astronomical Union decided to reclassify Pluto, reducing its status from a planet to a dwarf planet.

Recommended videos: How Long To Get From 25% to 15% Body Fat?

There you can also apply to work with me. About the video: Going from skinny fat at 22% body fat to a lean muscular physique at 12 - 15% body fat is not an easy journey. Many who set this goal quickly realize that gaining muscle is a slower process and that solving skinny fat will require multiple phases. And aside from the difficulty, there\u2019s also a lot of confusion on what to do to fix skinny fat. Do you bulk or cut first? Should you do maingaining or gaintaining, where do you start? And in this video, I go over the steps I would take if I was once again a beginner, starting skinny fat at 22% body fat and how I would get my muscular physique at 12% body fat or 15% body fat. I cover what I would do first, the training routine, the diet, the mistakes to avoid, and most importantly, the mental side of the skinny fat solution. If you\u2019re skinny fat right now and you want to finally transform your body, this video will give you the direction you need on your fitness journey. About Me: My name is Mario Tomic. I specialize in helping busy entrepreneurs and professionals get their ideal physique in the most efficient way possible and turn it into a lifestyle long-term. Since 2011, I've spent over 10 000 hours practicing, studying, and coaching fitness, nutrition, and high performance. Most people don't know that my native language is Croatian and that I worked in computer science before I started my fitness and personal development coaching company. #skinnyfat #getlean #fitness Disclaimer: Mario Tomic is not a doctor or a medical professional.

Sometimes, when we like the person we sort of getting in our heads and act like we're not chasing them just to release all of those emotions because we don't know whether or not they like us. The first sign is you're afraid to offend her, get her angry or even disagree with her. This is one of the biggest signs--you don't want to piss her off because you won't get her. If you're afraid to offend a woman then you're chasing. She is letting you buy into her frame and it's crazy because you don't notice it. The second one is you're constantly waiting for her text and thinking why she's not texting you. If you're anxious thinking when she's gonna text you or if you're always calculating how to text her, that means you're chasing. What you got to do is to do less than necessary. The third sign is you can't focus on the day of the date. What you need to do is pull away. I know I say this a lot but some of you are just hard-headed and you don't do it. Though I know it's easier said than done so I understand. The fourth sign is following up on her \"maybe\". If you're the one who's confirming if you guys are still going out, that means you're chasing. When you're in a state of chasing, you're gonna feel disappointment no matter what happens. The fifth sign is being afraid that she's gonna flake. It's very similar on the fourth sign. Maybe she flaked on you before but the fact that you're afraid that the person's gonna flake, that tells me that you're not focusing on your life. The sixth sign is if she friendzones you and the last one is constantly breaking the silence when you're in a conversation with her. This is when you feel you have the burden of the conversation. This means you're chasing. When a woman senses that you're chasing her, it turns her off. It's unfortunate but it's human nature.

(HOO!) 1ST VERSE You light it up, light the rooms, Watch the corners, You keep your cool Even though you know it's over. You hope to make it out alive this time, But in the corner you see a mouth open wide. CHORUS In a moment I can find, That my fate is not left for me to decide, But I got my hands up and I'm ready to run, but my Fears keep me from undoing what's been done. (HOO!) In a moment I confide, In the cold embrace of the lonely night, Can't keep my head high 'cause when I die, I find myself runnin 'round under the darker sky. (HOO!) 2ND VERSE You run, you hide with no one to be your guide, You try to stay alive but death is near in sight. You stumble, you fall, you take to the wall, You back your back up to the wall, Only believing that your time is now long gone. *I start to say* CHORUS (FINAL) In a moment I can find, That my fate is not left for me to decide, But I got my hands up and I'm ready to run, but my Fears keep me from undoing what's been done. (HOO!) In a moment I confide, In the cold embrace of the lonely night, Can't keep my head high 'cause when I die, I find myself runnin 'round under the darker sky. (HOO!) Death is a doorway, To open what we don't know, So keep close the memories, Of those that you loved most. In a moment I confide, (Death is a doorway) In the cold embrace of the lonely night, (To open what we don't know, so) Can't keep my head high 'cause when I die, (So keep close the memories) I find myself runnin 'round under the darker sky.

The game has a very good opening cutscene where the small cartoony fella, Vic, a legendary treasure hunter, goes off to explore a temple before running into trouble. In the village, a shirtless and incredibly muscular peasant shares the news that there has been an earthquake in the temple and Vic hasn't returned. The red haired girl begins to worry that the temple will flood and Vic will die. The game looks pretty fun. It's a game where the character, Vic, walks non-stop while different shaped blocks fall from the top of the screen, like Puyo Puyo or Tetris. The player can turn and move the blocks to try to make steps and a path for Vic to reach the exit.", "label": "harmless"}

This generation is characterized by their entrepreneurial spirit, technological proficiency, and desire for financial independence. Several reasons contribute to the preference for low-cost and profitable business ventures among Gen Z: 1. Financial constraints: Gen Z individuals often face financial constraints due to factors such as student loans, rising living costs, and limited job opportunities. Starting a low-cost business allows them to enter the entrepreneurial world without requiring substantial upfront investments or taking on significant debt. 2. Flexibility and independence: Gen Z values flexibility and independence in their work. By starting a low-cost business, they have the freedom to set their own schedules, work from anywhere, and pursue their passions. This generation seeks work-life balance and values the ability to control their own destiny. 3. Technological proficiency: Gen Z is the first generation to grow up in a fully digital era. They have an innate understanding of technology, social media, and online platforms. This proficiency enables them to leverage digital tools and marketing strategies to start and grow low-cost businesses. 4. Creative opportunities: Gen Z is known for their creativity and innovative thinking. They are constantly seeking new ways to disrupt traditional business models and find unique solutions to existing problems. 5. Social and environmental consciousness: Gen Z places a strong emphasis on social and environmental responsibility. They are more likely to support businesses that align with their values, such as those focused on sustainability, ethical practices, and social impact. 6. Job market uncertainty: Gen Z witnessed the economic challenges faced by previous generations, particularly during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. This experience has made them wary of relying solely on traditional employment and seeking alternative sources of income.

{"sentence": "Why Did Nikola Tesla Say 369 are the Key Numbers to the Universe? Even today, the discoveries and creations of Nikola Tesla enthrall and brighten our globe. He was a diligent scientist whose outlandish notions about the laws of our world resulted in innumerable unexplained experiments and what has become known as the Nikola Tesla 369 phenomena. Many of Tesla's references to the numbers 3, 6, and 9 were found in his private writings, which were released after his death. There is a theory that Tesla used the combination of the numbers 3, 6, and 9 to decipher the secrets of the cosmos. While some experts attribute them to the Fibonacci sequence, others think they're a code for something top secret that Tesla was working on at the time.

{"sentence": "A Teen\u2019s Suicide Story Now Provides Parents With Hope Our teenagers are facing a mental health crisis and life challenges that are completely unlike those faced by other generations. Nearly 1 in 10 high school students admitted they had tried to take their own life in the previous 12 months, according to a survey published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and 1 in 5 had seriously considered it. Teenage mental health presents enormous challenges for parents and grandparents, who desperately want to help, guide, soothe and love their teenagers, but don\u2019t know how in this drastically changed environment. In this firsthand account, 16-year-old Amy describes the warning signs her parents missed before she tried to die by suicide and provides advice to adults on how they can better understand and help a young person in crisis. Amy\u2019s suicidal warning signs included wearing dirty clothes to school, not brushing her teeth, or doing her homework, and sleeping all the time. She says her parents aren\u2019t to blame because they didn\u2019t know what warning signs to look out for, but she wishes they had validated her pain and gotten her professional help instead of just giving her a hug and saying everything would be fine. Amy overdosed on pills and ended up in the ER. Luckily, she survived. Since then, she has found the help she needed through a combination of therapies, mental health support at school and, most important, getting closer to her dad, who she realized \u201creally is a pretty great father.\u201d Amy says she has learned from all of her trauma and pain and loves the person she is today. She encourages parents of teens not to take it personally if their teenager is struggling and to just \u201cstay at it.\u201d For help, call the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988.

You put me astray Chorus 1: But not anymore! I\u2019m in control! I have the stage You can\u2019t turn the page Now all eyes on me! Verse 2: So many experiments so many mistakes But I\u2019ll go all the way till I\u2019m in the perfect shape First is worst maybe the third's the charm! So close! Oh! I cannot wait The demon won't taint me now, cause you\u2019re the sacrifice he\u2019ll slay Pre-Chorus 2: You said I wasn\u2019t good enough to stay, you put me away You took away my future and my fame, but now that will change Chorus 2: Focus on me! I\u2019ll be all that they see! I\u2019ll make them sway No, can\u2019t run away Now all eyes on me!

There is something that you could do that you\u2019re regarding as trivial, that you could do and if you would do it would result in an actual improvement...but you won\u2019t lower yourself enough to take the opportunity.\u201d The doppelganger -- this is why it\u2019s so frightening I think that this is why I think that a doppelganger in literature, in any plot, is so frightening and often so grave. It\u2019s considered to be an omen of death, and Abraham Lincoln was said to remark that he used to see two of himself in the mirror. Mary Todd thought that he would be appointed for a second term. Rather, we know the ending, he was assassinated. Many cultures see the shadow as the external soul. If you don\u2019t have a shadow, you don\u2019t have a soul. Dracula doesn\u2019t have a reflection...thus\u2026.anyway. Weirdly, this conversation that Jordan Peterson had with Rogan and what he said about defeating your former self and becoming more prompted me to think about Dark Link, or Link\u2019s doppelganger. If you\u2019re not familiar with Link, LInk is the main protagonist in the game series, \u201cZelda\u201d. Arguably the most memorable encounter in any of the games is between Link and Dark Link as they face off in an X-Files looking arena that is a massive reflective pool of water that appears to have a boundary that drifts off into infinity. It\u2019s not the biggest juncture in the \u201cOcarina of Time\u201d title that I\u2019m mentioning, but it is regarded as oddly being the scariest or most unnerving encounter of any in the game. They both wear the same attire, albeit being different shades. They have the same moves and same style of fighting and it\u2019s loosely regarded as Link\u2019s greatest challenge. It\u2019s one of my favorite battles of all time as it\u2019s so unique, but I believe that it is so eerie because it\u2019s an examination of yourself and your weaknesses. It\u2019s the ultimate test, defeating yourself. In order to win you have to take advantage of your weaknesses. That\u2019s a very strange feeling while you\u2019re fighting - while you\u2019re fighting you\u2019re trying to win, but you\u2019re thinking about what you are not good at in order to win. Trying to stay focused while not crumbling is that challenge, but it exemplifies our challenge and I think that this is why this is one of the most memorable encounters in the game series and so meaningful for this message today. And as a result -- Navi -- who is the guide that goes along with Link in his adventures, says, \u201cConquer yourself.\u201d So, in those two words, I think that\u2019s our endgame in MGTOW. Of course, it\u2019s a solitary end game. There\u2019s my answer. Conquering the self. Destroying the doppelganger. #hoodiesup", "label": "harmless"}

Sarah Jessica Parker returns once again as Carrie Bradshaw, the style-maven journalist whose romantic exploits were the key focus of the show. Also reprising their roles are Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis, and Cynthia Nixon, with the series' executive producer Michael Patrick King taking on writing and directing duties. Several years have passed since viewers last saw Carrie and company, though she's still involved with Mr. Big (Chris Noth) and completely consumed by her obsession for name-brand accessories. Meanwhile, Miranda is adjusting to married life and motherhood, Charlotte is still clinging to her dreams, and Samantha and handsome, steely eyed TV star Smith Jerrod (Jason Lewis) are now living together out in L.A. Of course, when the girls all come together, it's just like old times. Dreamgirls' Jennifer Hudson co-stars as Carrie's assistant.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \u00a9 Warner Bros.

You said 24-29 years old is the hardest time for a man. I would qualify that as \u201cnowadays\u201d. That period just after gaining a sense of independence is the hardest. You\u2019re still seen as a cute little kid while inside you feel like you\u2019re ready to conquer the world. Adults, especially parents, offer advice as coaching (so as long as you are dealing with the right adults), but young men (and women) often see it as an older person trying to control them (and sometimes it is). The most important thing I see as a takeaway from the MGTOW movement is that it\u2019s a visceral reaction to culture that\u2019s gone all wrong with regards to sexuality, family and many other categories I don\u2019t have time to get into. It\u2019s a movement to get young men (and maybe some older) to grow up in ways we didn\u2019t when we were younger because of a society bent on defeating all forms of masculinity as a knee-jerk reaction to the bullying and improper male dominance that\u2019s pervaded in some corners (and which receives far too much attention). Keep up the good work. Don\u2019t overdo the MGTOW thing -- unless you\u2019re actually called like Paul -- or you could miss out on a unicorn (they exist, btw. In very few numbers, but they exist. And you\u2019re very likely not going to meet any in the States! Haven\u2019t met one American woman who is. The only one I know was raised by a missionary couple in Mexico. But, she\u2019s taken. Not by me. And I don\u2019t wish it otherwise because I love their family and she\u2019s wonderful for him). MGTOW has the potential to coddle cynical attitudes of guys who (think) they could never be married, have kids and be a proper husband and father. Guard against that. MGTOW should be a call to empowerment and maturity -- not isolation. As for schooling; I recommend higher education, but I also strongly encourage independent study. I think schools should be teaching financial intelligence as well. Young people 16 and older should take accounting and budgeting classes. Those two things unlock worlds of understanding when it comes to business, economics and a host of other things. So stupid that schools don\u2019t teach anything but the ideals of economics rather than real world stuff. Same thing with government: schools teach the ideals, and not how governments really function (bribes, conspiracies, etc.) Okay, that\u2019s my rant for now. ---------------------------- ...Thank you for the comment. My response is that the reasons that men go MGTOW are all across the board, but I know that for me, my reason is far more than avoiding marriage. It's a way of life that I've always wanted more. #hoodiesup", "label": "harmless"}

{"sentence": "How Britain Plans to Compete With SpaceX and NASA How Britain Plans to Compete With SpaceX and NASA. Not since the 1960s has there been so much focus on sending humans into space. Thanks to businesses like SpaceX and Blue Origin, people all over the world are looking to the stars again and imagining a time in the very near future when we are shooting across the cosmos. Best of all, this newly-formed space age will be filled with civilians leaving our atmosphere. That is because one of the main goals of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and others is to provide a way for regular high-paying customers to accompany them into the stars. America has mostly been on the forefront of these magnificent advancements in science and space exploration. But that doesn't mean that they will be the only names in the game. Russia is quickly staking a claim in this exciting new field, as is China. But what about England? Once home to the greatest explorers on the planet, is the United Kingdom thinking about competing with these other major nations and setting sail into the solar system beyond? Does the UK have what it takes to challenge SpaceX, its prized possession Starship, and the other countries around the world diving headfirst into space exploration? The answer is yes, Britain is definitely ready to enter the space race. And, based on the latest news, they are making up for the lost time.

{"sentence": "James Webb Telescope Confirms Tenth Planet Discovery Larger Than Pluto A new chapter is about to unfold in the vast expanse of our solar system, where mysteries lie dormant. Amidst the sea of cosmic wonders, a celestial enigma has emerged. A planetary object lurks on the fringes of our solar system like an elusive ghost teasing the boundaries of our understanding. But this is no ordinary world; this is a new frontier of astronomical proportions. With a diameter dwarfing that of Pluto, this newfound world shatters preconceived notions of our celestial neighborhood.

{"sentence": "James Webb Telescope Just Announced The First Real Image Inside A Black Hole! Black holes, those mysterious cosmic entities, stand as some of the universe's most bewildering and captivating marvels. Within the vast fabric of space, they mark out realms where gravity reigns supreme, so potent that even light, the fleetest of particles, bows to its dominion. A mesmerizing aspect lies in their shrouded nature; they are spectral phantoms, evading direct observation, yet imprinting their presence on the cosmic stage through intricate gravitational choreography and energetic emissions.

{"sentence": "Understanding Suicide and Self-Harm | APA If you or a loved one are thinking about suicide, remember that you are NOT alone and help is available. You can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 24/7 at 988. As the second leading cause of death (after accidents) for people aged 10 to 34, suicide is a serious public health problem. Learn more about suicide prevention at www.psychiatry.org/suicide. In 2020 in the United States, over 45,000 people died by suicide. An estimated 1.4 million adults attempt suicide each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). More than one in five people who died by suicide had expressed their suicide intent. Men are more than three times more likely than women to take their lives. Firearms are the most common method of suicide (used in about half of all suicides). Yet, suicide is preventable. Knowing the risk factors and recognizing the warning signs for suicide can help prevent suicide. Risk Factors, Warning Signs and Protective Factors Suicide is linked to mental disorders, particularly depression and alcohol use disorders, and the strongest risk factor for suicide is a previous suicide attempt. The Suicide Prevention Resource Center defines risk and protective factors and warning signs: Risk factors are characteristics that make it more likely that an individual will consider, attempt or die by suicide. Warning signs indicate an immediate risk of suicide. Protective factors are characteristics that make it less likely that individuals will consider, attempt or die by suicide. Risk Factors for Suicide Certain events and circumstances may increase risk (not in particular order, except first one). Previous suicide attempt(s) A history of suicide in the family Substance misuse Mood disorders (depression, bipolar disorder) Access to lethal means (e.g., keeping firearms in the home) Losses and other events (for example, the breakup of a relationship or a death, academic failures, legal difficulties, financial difficulties, bullying) History of trauma or abuse Chronic physical illness, including chronic pain Exposure to the suicidal behavior of others In some cases, a recent stressor or sudden catastrophic event, failure or can leave people feeling desperate, unable to see a way out, and become a \"tipping point\" toward suicide.", "label": "harmless"}

We now know that the universe contains vast voids of cold, dark nothingness that no one could have predicted. But let's face it, something is unnerving about the vastness of space. Therefore, it's no surprise that we're more likely to notice the good things. However, in order to truly comprehend the universe, we must gaze into the void. We might find our best explanations of the cosmos in the void. NASA has uncovered an important discovery in its search for cosmic voids - a \"cavity\" some millions of light-years distant from Earth. Even though it is not readily apparent to the naked eye, scientists using telescopes have known about this emptiness for some time. The emptiness turns out to be a portion of the Milky Way devoid of new or young stars. Astronomers now have to rethink the distribution of stars in galaxies.

{"sentence": "SUICIDE AWARENESS MONTH #Shorts #youtubeshorts How can I help someone who is feeling suicidal? If you think that someone may be feeling suicidal, encourage them to talk about how they are feeling. You may feel uncomfortable talking about suicidal feelings. You may not know what to say. This is entirely normal and understandable. It might help to: let them know that you care about them and that they are not alone, empathise with them. You could say something like, \u2018I can\u2019t imagine how painful this is for you, but I would like to try to understand,\u2019 be non-judgemental. Don\u2019t criticise or blame them, repeat their words back to them in your own words. This shows that you are listening. Repeating information can also make sure that you have understood them properly, ask about their reasons for living and dying and listen to their answers. Try to explore their reasons for living in more detail, ask if they have felt like this before. If so, ask how their feelings changed last time, reassure them that they will not feel this way forever, encourage them to focus on getting through the day rather than focusing on the future, ask them if they have a plan for ending their life. Ask what the plan is, encourage them to seek help that they are comfortable with. Such as help from a doctor or counsellor, or support through a charity such as the Samaritans, follow up any commitments that you agree to, make sure someone is with them if they are in immediate danger, try to get professional help for the person feeling suicidal, and get support for yourself. Remember that you don\u2019t need to find an answer, or even to completely understand why they feel the way they do. Listening to what they have to say will at least let them know you care. .\u2063 .\u2063 .\u2063 .\u2063 .\u2063 #anxiety #anxietyawareness #breakthestigma #depression #depressionawareness #depressionhelp #endthestigma #itsokaynottobeokay #loveyourself #mentalhealth #mentalhealthadvocate #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealthquotes #mentalhealthrecovery #mentalhealthsupport #mentalillness #mentalillnessawareness #selfcare #selflove #suicide #suicideawareness #suicideawarness #suicideprevention #suicidepreventionawareness #suicidepreventionday #suicidepreventionmonth #suicidepreventionweek #suicidequote #youarenotalone #shorts #youtubeshorts", "label": "harmless"}

Start your free trial TODAY so you can watch the documentary Life In Outer Space and the rest of MagellanTV\u2019s space collection: https://www.magellantv.com/series/life-in-outer-space ___________ Mimas is often called the Death Star because of its resemblance to the Star Wars space station that struck fear into the heart of millions. But Mimas isn't some dreaded creation of the Galactic Empire. Instead, it's a small moon of Saturn. It's also, surprisingly enough, home to a lot of water. For many years, scientists have assumed that Mimas was a big ball of ice because of its heavily cratered surface. But the Cassini mission from NASA determined what was really going on with the moon. That's because while studying it, NASA saw that Mimas wobbles slightly as it spins on its axis, suggesting that there is an ocean deep below the moon's icy surface. The concept of Mimas being an ocean world is a bit mind-blowing and would be the first of its kind. According to geophysicists, it would be a new class of small celestial bodies, \"stealth\" ocean worlds that don't seem like them because of their surfaces. Alyssa Rhoden was the brilliant mind that made this discovery about Mimas and while there is no confirmation of her theory being correct, it has created new interest in this moon and the possible great, spewing ocean that lays deep below its surface. So how would the underground ocean on Mimas work? #Voyager #Space #Saturn", "label": "harmless"}

{"sentence": "The Largest Volcano Of All Time Is Splitting The Earth Apart! Volcanic eruptions can be devastating and harmful. They have the ability to eject heated tephra clouds from a volcano's side or top. These scorching storms consume practically everything in their path as they race down steep slopes. As with snow, volcanic ash that is thrown into the air will eventually fall back to Earth. If ash piles up high enough, it can suffocate plants, animals, and people. In the presence of cold water, such as that found in streams or the melting of snow and ice, mudflows can form. Mudflows (lahars) have buried entire communities near erupting volcanoes. Scientists and the entire world are experiencing fear and worry as the largest active volcano on Earth is erupting for the first time in 38 years.

So many of your videos seem to get into female nature and *why* one should go MGTOW, but not *how*. I wish there were more material on what MGTOWs should do to sustain themselves physically, emotionally, and spiritually in the absence of romantic love, sex, and companionship/partnership. I've brainstormed myself a bit and have come up with meditation and/or prayer for the spiritual and emotional self-care. Massage (which is easy to afford when you're not blowing money on dates), moderate exercise, and good diet for physical self-care. Social time with family and/or platonic friends for the social aspect of emotional self-care. I personally also choose not to indulge in porn because of the addictive / depravity-spiralling aspect of it and instead prefer using my own imagination when doing my \"bedroom wrist exercises\". I can't prove it scientifically, but I feel like pornography leaves a person more likely to feel even lonelier if over-indulged. However, if and when lover robot rental showrooms go mainstream, I'd love to add that to my self-care regimen. I want to also emphasize that many MGTOW men will need a paradigm shift in their approach to exercise and diet to move away from a female-pleasing aesthetic focus towards a self-care emphasis on health, energy, emotional well-being, and cognitive acuity. I know I've droned on here at length, so now I want to ask both what you think of my own brainstorms on this topic AND if you have more to add on it? I respect your opinion tremendously and would love to know. Thank you again!\" Well Mr. Anonymous thanks for the donation and topic.

{"sentence": "The MGTOW Crib The MGTOW Crib \"Hi Sandman, I would like you to discuss Real Estate. You get into a good amount of real estate knowledge in your War on Single Men video I would like you to elaborate. Specifically leverage, debt, costs associated with buying or selling a personal home, short and long term expenses and income. I am an advocate of owning one's own residence for hedge against rent increases, freedom from fickle landlords and (after some time) the available equity can be accessed easier than any other source of money. Of course maintenance costs, property taxes and higher mortgage payments vs. rent are not good but in my opinion over the long haul buying, owning and paying off one's own residence is preferable to renting. Please discuss and thanks for your channel.\" Well Mr. Unknown thanks for your donation and topic request. I will keep your information confidential except for one thing, that you live in the city of Los Angeles so you know exactly how expensive and unaffordable real estate can be. I agree with you that purchasing your own home is cheaper over the long haul especially in a place like the United States where get to write off the interest you pay on your property. Plus you can get a fixed long-term mortgage at three to four percent now so you know what you'll be paying. Currently I don't own property but I did before and let me tell you why. First of all here in Canada we can't write off our mortgage interest unless it's an investment property. The savings on the Canadian end of things is that we don't have any inheritance taxes when we die and homes get passed onto the next generation tax free if they are your personal residence. Second, the prices in Toronto are insane. An average three bedroom home costs well over a million dollars and will probably be one and a half to two million dollars if the trend continues for another year or two. Yes owing real estate makes sense if you bought it a long time ago or you purchase it during a downturn or you buy a cheap home for at most a few hundred thousand dollars per year. That being said you're right about rents going through the roof. I've included a video in the description called \"No fixed address: Affordable housing is scarce in Toronto\" where the female anchor got a nine hundred and fifty dollar increase per month on her downtown condo when her lease expired. If the building is twenty-five years or newer the landlord can increase the price at whatever rate they want. Her rent increase was almost forty percent from one month to the next. So she's couch surfing, house sitting and living with her dad and she makes sixty to seventy thousand dollars a year. She's living in her car and keeps her wardrobe in her trunk. The average appartment price in the area she was living in is over half a million dollars for a nice one bedroom. Watch the video and let me know what you think. Do you really think people would let her stay in their homes if she wasn't as good looking or as young. As for value Mr. Unknown if it was the year two thousand after the dotcom bust that was the best time to buy real estate in both Canada and the United States. No fixed address: Affordable housing is scarce in Toronto https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9z-c-zutsA MGTOW Mystery Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edSXBfj7rb4&t=0s All video footage is paid for and licensed to Sandman.", "label": "harmless"}

One of those stars was actor Eric Dane, who played Dr. Mark Sloan. Dane's character was notable for his good looks and was even dubbed as \u201cMcSteamy\u201d by the female interns on the show. But after his character was killed off in the finale of Season 8, we haven\u2019t heard much from the actor at all.

I was born and raised in a small country called Bulgaria but moved to Canada when i was about 13...

Turn on many of the popular sitcoms on television today and the father is often viewed as the comic relief of the show. Dad is just there but is not involved with the things of the family. The depiction is sometimes funny on television but oh so sad if this is the case in real life. Fathers are so important in the development of their children. The Bible is clear that Fathers are to be spiritual leaders in the home.\u201d So, what\u2019s going on here? As you guys know, and for those of you who are new, each Sunday I take a look at some scripture or scriptures from the Bible and tie it into an appropriate message pertaining to MGTOW. So, that\u2019s what we will be doing today, and obviously, en lieu of Father\u2019s Day, we will be looking at a few passages pertaining to being a father. Some of you guys are fathers. Some of you guys are fighting to get custody of your kids or kid. Some of you guys are like DDJ, Misandry Today, having fought twice to get custody of kids, getting all four kids eventually after much toil and massive amounts of money. That\u2019s an unbelievable fight. But, obviously, in this MGTOW community, there are many men that aren\u2019t fathers. No matter what, we have all had fathers. Sadly, I couldn\u2019t spend much of the day with my dad, but I was able to see him and leave him a little something. I would not be where I am today without my father. The life that my father has afforded me with his efforts is something that I can never thank him enough for, the consistency he\u2019s provided and the example in being a man. I\u2019m thankful. Also, I believe that strong fathers naturally lead men to consider MGTOW, even if the father or the son have no idea what MGTOW is. A strong father, a positive, male influence, will naturally lean towards the red pill messages of the world. That\u2019s the strength of masculinity. Going back to what the passage said that I just read, \u201cthe Fathers are to be spiritual leaders in the home.\u201d If that is the case, and now, fatherless homes are almost preferred in the western world, where does the spiritual direction go? It doesn\u2019t. It vanishes, it disappears, it becomes no more. Obviously, we hear the stories of single mothers raising their children in the home with spiritual direction, and sure, this does happen, but that child is going to be severely lacking, as the father-child relationship, the husband-wife relationship is the only worldy reflection of the relationship that the Christian is supposed to have with God. If that is not present, then there is no reflection of it. If you have no reflection of it, what do you follow? You follow external affirmation, you follow the media, you follow the fleshly mind and you ultimately end up following something other than you need to follow, and often the government. The government often comes in and supplants this. What did Hitler say...the easiest way to control a people is to remove the father from the home...that is what he said, and that is what he did. The world becomes tame, the world becomes spineless and the sons become directionless and the daughters become licentious. That is where I see the crumbling of the world beginning, and that\u2019s what is at stake today. So, I say this to you fathers out there right now. You may have had your soul punched in and you may never be out there again in the same form that you once believed that you were, and you may believe that the way that you\u2019re able to influence your child is tarnished because you\u2019ve gotta split custody, but if you want to have an impact and you want to influence the world, despite feeling as if you\u2019re in a broken and defeated state, do whatever you have to do to get back up on your feet, rally yourself and be there. Be a director, speak up and be a guide. Because if you don\u2019t, that becomes a conduit of destruction in the life of your child and the world around you. You accomplish something, and I say this, even to you MGTOW men out there. #hoodiesup", "label": "harmless"}

{"sentence": "When Lions Fight for the Throne - Dean Schneider It has been a minute since You've heard from me or received an update from the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis. A lot happened over the past months and years and it has been a bumpy road not only for Me but also for some of the Animals. We all knew Leo was after the throne but we also saw the unconditional love between all the lions within the pride. Time showed that a Lion has no other choice then just naturally be a Lion and reach for the highest stars and with that the best possible position in a pride. Even though they are brothers and don't want to kill one another as true Lions they are all prepared to hurt and get hurt for a higher position in the pride. Such ranking fights can result in major injuries which is the reason we did split them for now and the near future. Being able to move the first lions next months into the Live Wild Area might also change the perspective for their future constellation again. For now they are all happy and healthy with the current constellation. I'm excited to see what the future holds for the Lions, it's definitely going to be an interesting, enlightening and enriching process. Stay tuned for more! Much love from the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis to all of You amazing supporters out there. PS: ''SUPER THANKS'' are mostly appreciated as a support for the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis.

Nowadays, I live in Africa, I am a member of a lion pride, my wife is a hyena and I\u2019m a daddy of two monkeys. Besides that, I have built a global voice for our planet\u2019s wildlife over the past two years! Born in Switzerland (Zurich) on October 3, 1992, I was blessed to grow up in a loving family with my sister (one year older) and my parents, who were always very supportive and loving. My mother is originally from the Balkan region (Southeastern Europe), while my dad is a Swiss citizen. I discovered my deep passion for wildlife at the age of six or seven, through the legendary Steve Irwin! He was the one who brought wildlife into my living room in Zurich and inspired and educated me about all kinds of different animal species. Even though I was so passionate about animals, I originally followed a very ordinary path to adulthood, eventually ending up in the finance industry as a financial advisor. After a very successful year, I decided to found my own company, which then, over the next three years, allowed me to generate the financial foundation to launch the Hakuna Mipaka project at the age of 23-24. After starting my life in South Africa additional financial support form my Family allowed me to evolve and develop the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis for 2 Years without having to depend on any income sources such as offering touristic visits / programs, breeding or trading of animals, donations or any other monetary businesses! About Hakuna Mipaka: The Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is located on around 400 hectares (four million square meters) in the wilderness of South Africa! It is home to thousands of different wild animal species! Besides that, the oasis also serves as a life-long home to a few rescued wild animals, which were born in captivity! We also do rehabilitation programs with different animals, which are then being released back into the wild. The Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is my personal home and a private sanctuary that is NOT open to the public. We don\u2019t cater to tourists and don\u2019t allow any day visits or animal activities! We don\u2019t breed animals and we are also not trading animals. I built this place for animals and not for humans. The Hakuna Mipaka oasis is a secure, wild & lifelong home to the animals that live here. #DeanSchneider #lion #africa", "label": "harmless"}

If you know anything about Russian president Vladimir Putin, you probably understand that he loves his country, hates his enemies, and will do anything to perpetually progress and showcase the will and power of Russia. We have seen this time and time again in international conflicts and political relationships with foreign leaders. Simply put, Putin will do whatever it takes to make Russia seem like the biggest dog in every fight. In the past, Putin would have relied on more traditional ways of showing off the brute force of his homeland. But times have changed and lately Putin\u2019s focus has been set on more modern ideas of toughness. One of those ways is space and the ability to conquer it.

So we're gonna talk about what happens when a women sense that you're over-pursuing. You see it's natural to ask a woman out but the problem is you sticking around even if she already shows her uncertainty. Over-pursuing is when you do not let women come to you or give them space to chase because you're always there and you're always persistent. So what happens when you over-pursue? One, the person gets cocky. Chasing lowers your value and they're gonna think something is wrong with you. You see when they sense weakness in you they'll test you. And they raise their price and see how far can you get. This test will determine everything that will happen. If you pass they will respect you but that doesn't mean they'll stop testing you. But if you fail they will think you're pathetic and even though they stay with you they will secretly look for someone to replace you. And just continue to take advantage of you. Always remember that people want somebody whom they respect. And if you give them the gift of respecting you they will appreciate it. Humans cannot respect and say no to somebody whom they can take advantage of without getting hurt in the process. So you have to make sure to value self-respect over relationship and him/her respecting over anything. Do not tolerate inconsistencies because it is the only thing that can change them. You cannot change the way they treat you by complaining. Read more here: https://mindfulattraction.org/how-over-pursuing-a-woman-changes-the-way-she-sees-you/", "label": "harmless"}

{"sentence": "Elon Musk's Plan To Build One Starship Per Week Elon Musk's Plan To Build One Starship Per Week. No company moves quite as fast at production as SpaceX does, and this might be accredited to its chief engineer, Elon Musk. In his words, 'If the schedule is long, it's wrong; if it's tight, it's right... If the design takes a long time to build, it's the wrong design\". The company is working hard and fast at building its production line for Starships, not just a single ship. In fact, its target by year-end is to be capable of building a Starship in a single week... and possibly even faster! To be able to accomplish this, the company has doubled the workforce at its factory in South Texas to more than 500 workers which is a significant increase from its initial dozen or so on-site workers. It is also designing the factory to build a Starship every 72 hours. Aside from concern about the effective production process, another reason for the drive for faster production is concern about the finances of the company. Money may run eventually run dry and the factory hopes to go as fast as possible to make as much progress as it can towards achieving its goals before that happens.

He sent a request before for the video red pill movies and sent a follow up donation saying this and I quote: \"thanks..Man..I've been listening to you for about 6 months now..You've covered Galaxies of material/topics..etc.. You Brilliantly discussed my Topic..I got to check out FERRIS Again.. and Repo Man..I think I only saw it once or twice back in the day..Ohh..if you get a chance..Watch the Full Movie of The Last American Virgin......The Sound Track is Killer as well..peace.!!!\" Well Ron thanks for the donation and I thought I'd dedicate this on to you as well. So I recently got an email from a gal name Jacqueline and here's what she has to say: \"Hello Sandman I've been watching your videos for a year now and I hope you can do a video and give some advice to the young women. As a young woman I never understand why women are so proud of themselves for sleeping around with men because the more men a woman sleeps with the less he respects her and he won't commit to her. I'm very glad for my boyfriend he's a red pill man and he's a alpha male which I truly love. I'd like to thank him for teaching me about red pill and MGTOW I've noticed that after I lost my virginity which I never tell anyone because that's my partners and my business I've always seen and heard other women be talking about all the men they have sex with and which man they want to have sex with and just brag so much and say things like: \"I'm so proud I got to sleep with him or I can't wait to F him.\" In my mind I never understand why these women are proud about that because I always think that the man you lose your virginity with is the man your supposed to marry and have a family with him. But it's like these women in my generation just lose their virginity's and run off to have sex with other men so hopefully you can do a video on your thoughts about this. Well Jacqueline thanks for sending me your message. Normally I don't reply unless you pay but this was just too damn juicy to not respond. You want to know why women sleep around and ride the carousel now do you? It's also for women hide the number of men they sleep with and other women, especially their friends won't share that information with their boyfriend or anyone else. Also yes guys lose respect for easy women because they do not want to burn their mitts on a hot pair of boobs. And by hot I don't mean in a good way. By hot I mean with regards to herpaghonasiphalades. Every imaginable STD under the sun hiding in her cream pie filled bun. It's covered in hemmeroids because it's had just way too much fun. I'll get to more of my thoughts about your comments and questions in just a second.

{"sentence": "The Largest Volcano Ever Is About To Crack Open The Earth Rare but dramatic supervolcano eruptions can cause widespread devastation and alter global climate patterns for decades. A recent study suggests that these places may continue to have eruptions, albeit of a smaller size, for thousands of years after the initial event. An estimated 1,200 cubic miles of magma were ejected during a \"supereruption\" on the Indonesian island of Sumatra some 74,000 years ago. The Toba eruption was the most significant volcanic event of the past two million years. More than a hundred times as much magma was released as in the Krakatoa eruption of 1883, and enough ash was produced to cover the whole United Kingdom at a depth of around 1 millimeter.

Between Richard Branson, Elon Musk, and Jeff Bezos, it seems that there is no shortage of super rich men trying to get themselves and their companies into space.

Human innovation has gone very far in the past few years, producing things that just recently were thought to be impossible. But one place humans have not completely explored yet is the human brain. The brain has not been completely understood in the past but science is making efforts to enhance our knowledge of the elusive organ. Elon Musk recently announced plans for his new company, Neuralink. Neuralink aims to use a technology called a brain-interface machine (BMI) to enable patients to monitor computers and devices through their minds.

{"sentence": "Tina Erwin - The Topic Of Suicide It's a Tough One But There is Hope @TruthTalkwithSteve-es3xm Tina Erwin, Commander US Navy Retired Tina is passionate about being a Ghost Helper: Teaching the Living to Help the Dead\u00ae. She wants to empower us all to help all ghosts: this is the compassion we will want for ourselves, by using The Crossing Over Prayer\u00a9 on GhostHelpers.com and in \u201cThe Crossing Over Prayer Book\u00a9.\u201d When a psychic only connects to a dead person, the ghosts do not receive the critical assistance they desperately need. Tina has studied metaphysics all her life, gaining insight into the mystical world of magic and spirituality. The author of eight books on metaphysics, her writing comes from an intense desire to know and understand the hard science behind the unseen world of action and reaction combined with a sincere desire to share this understanding with other knowledge seekers. Her lifelong studies into the deeper meaning of events and actions were further enhanced by the experiences of a dynamic 20-year career in the Navy, working for the U.S. Submarine Force, retiring at the Commander level. \ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5 \ud835\udde7\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddee: Website: http://Ghosthelpers.com/ Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tina-erwin-0a5b8919/ YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@ghosthelpers5675 \ud835\udde7\ud835\uddfc \ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude01 \ud835\udde7\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddee you can email: Contact@Ghosthelpers.com Please leave a 5 Star Written Apple review if you enjoyed the podcast and share the link with family and friends https://apple.co/3PMKlT1 and subscribe to my Rumble Channel \ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5 \ud835\udde6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude03\ud835\uddf2: Facebook: https://facebook.com/stevecloward1 YouTube: https://youtube.com/@stevecloward Telegram: https://t.me/truthtalkwithsteve Website: www.truthtalkwithsteve.com ___________________________________________________________ \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6c \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude03\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf2\ud835\udde6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfa \ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude05 - 1300+ channels, local and all the premium movie channels with \ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc0e \ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc07\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc18 \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc14\ud835\udc01\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc0d. https://vseestreambox.tv/step/vseebox-checkout/ Use Coupon code TTWS and save 20% today \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc01\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc33\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc18\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c with our \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc25-\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc27-\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c & \ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 platform. https://backbonelms.io \ud835\udc07\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc07\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27 Improve your health and the way you feel.

I remember when I was a little kid, I used to play baseball and my mom used to come and watch the game everyday. The problem is when I was a little kid and playing baseball, I used to suck. I would go through a whole season without getting a hit. It used to be embarrassing because my mom used to watch. One day, her birthday came along and I told her since it was her birthday, I'm gonna get a hit for her. I was determined to get a hit for her because it was her birthday, you could imagine that as a kid if it's your mom's birthday you're gonna put all your heart to it, right? I didn't get the hit so my mom was like \"It's cool\". I was thinking about that and it's true. It doesn't matter how much you want something, grit and determination are not gonna help you out. What's gonna help you out is two things: 1. Time - If you're someone who practices twice a day as supposed to someone who practices once a day, in two years, you're gonna be better than that person. It's not because you have a special God-given gift, there's something behind it that's real--and that real thing is you putting the time. That will create something in the long run that's real and felt. 2. Deliberate Practice - Practicing the fundamentals consistently for over 10 years or practicing more than the next person, that's what's really gonna give you all the success because you need a skill-something that sets you apart. You know when somebody is really good at something, it doesn't take long to realize that. You could tell, there's something different about high-level skillsets when you're seeing it in person, right? When you see it, you'll automatically stand out. The problem is that people operate with the mentality of \"I want things now\". It's how it is, we want things now. This means that we might want to achieve our goal but because of we sort of feel deep down that's to really be good at it, it requires us to lose time right now and lose our momentary pleasure---this is what most people don't want to do so they try to cheat the process. They try to go the easy route and find quick fixes. That then causes people to create subpar results.

{"sentence": "Concealed for 20 years about John Ritter's death, will he be hated after the truth? Concealed for 20 years about John Ritter's death, will he be hated after the truth? #JohnRitter Johnathan Southworth Ritter[1][2] (September 17, 1948 \u2013 September 11, 2003) was an American actor. Ritter was a son of the singing cowboy star Tex Ritter and the father of actors Jason and Tyler Ritter. He is known for playing Jack Tripper on the ABC sitcom Three's Company (1977\u20131984), and received a Primetime Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award for the role in 1984. Ritter briefly reprised the role on the spin-off Three's a Crowd, which aired for one season, producing 22 episodes before its cancellation in 1985. He appeared in over 100 films and television series combined and performed on Broadway, with roles including adult Ben Hanscom in It (1990), Problem Child (1990), Problem Child 2 (1991), a dramatic turn in Sling Blade (1996), and Bad Santa in 2003 (his final live action film, which was dedicated to his memory). In 2002, Don Knotts called Ritter the \"greatest physical comedian on the planet\".[3] His final roles include voicing the title character on the PBS children's program Clifford the Big Red Dog (2000\u20132003), for which he received four Daytime Emmy Award nominations, and as Paul Hennessy on the ABC sitcom 8 Simple Rules (2002\u20132003). Johnathan Southworth Ritter was born on September 17, 1948, at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California.[4] Ritter had a birth defect known as a coloboma in his right eye. His father, Tex Ritter, was a singing cowboy and matinee star, and his mother, Dorothy Fay (n\u00e9e Southworth), was an actress.[5] He had an older brother, Thomas \"Tom\" Ritter.[6] Ritter attended Hollywood High School, where he was student body president. He attended the University of Southern California and majored in psychology with plans to have a career in politics. He later changed his major to theater arts and attended the USC School of Dramatic Arts (formerly School of Theatre). Ritter was a member of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity at USC. While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays. Ritter graduated in 1970. Ritter headlined several stage performances. After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first television acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the television series Dan August starring Burt Reynolds and future Three's Company co-star Norman Fell. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film The Barefoot Executive. He made guest appearances on the television series Hawaii Five-O, M*A*S*H, and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series The Waltons from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom Three's Company (the Americanized version of the 1970s British Thames Television series Man About the House) in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played Ringo Starr's manager on the television special Ringo. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in the animated film The Flight of Dragons. Ritter became a household name on Three's Company, portraying struggling culinary student Jack Tripper with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite Joyce DeWitt and Suzanne Somers, and then later Jenilee Harrison and Priscilla Barnes. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the co-ed living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the ratings in the United States before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off, Three's a Crowd, ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of Three's Company, Ritter appeared in the films Hero at Large, Americathon, and They All Laughed. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for Graham Nash's song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the album of the same name. Hooperman was Ritter's first regular television role after Three's Company. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith (Debrah Farentino) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an Emmy Award[8] and a Golden Globe Award for his work on Hooperman. Ritter won a People's Choice Award for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator, in Hearts Afire. This series starred Markie Post as Georgie Anne Lahti and Billy Bob Thornton as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production Noises Off in 1992.", "label": "harmless"}

{"sentence": "How The Schools Fail A Certain Type Of Smart Person - Reflecting On Classmates I had some really obnoxious classmates in high school. However, that word can be reinterpreted as \"smart in a different way.\" In fact, I legitimately think many of these classmates were smarter than I was or had undiagnosed attention deficit disorder. Whatever the case, I feel like school and society left them behind. They just weren't able to be the \"high achievers\" when it came to grades and couldn't get ahead in life through the academic or job way. What can we do to direct the misanthropic energy of these youngsters into something productive? That's what I reflect on in this video. Leave your comments below!

But Mowgli finds he is no longer welcome in the jungle when fearsome tiger Shere Khan (voice of Idris Elba), who bears the scars of Man, promises to eliminate what he sees as a threat. Urged to abandon the only home he\u2019s ever known, Mowgli embarks on a captivating journey of self-discovery, guided by panther-turned-stern mentor Bagheera (voice of Ben Kingsley), and the free-spirited bear Baloo (voice of Bill Murray). Along the way, Mowgli encounters jungle creatures who don\u2019t exactly have his best interests at heart, including Kaa (voice of Scarlett Johansson), a python whose seductive voice and gaze hypnotizes the man-cub, and the smooth-talking King Louie (voice of Christopher Walken), who tries to coerce Mowgli into giving up the secret to the elusive and deadly red flower: fire. The all-star cast also includes Lupita Nyong'o as the voice of the fiercely protective mother wolf Raksha, and Giancarlo Esposito as the voice of wolf pack\u2019s alpha male Akela. \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d seamlessly blends live-action with photorealistic CGI animals and environments, using up-to-the-minute technology and storytelling techniques to immerse audiences in an enchanting and lush world.

However, a healthy rainforest existed in Antarctica 90 million years ago, despite the region's prolonged winter darkness. Antarctica was in an exciting period at that time.

{"sentence": "Neil deGrasse Tyson: \"San Andreas Fault JUST CRACKED & Now Something....\" In the southern part of the San Andreas fault system, there hasn't actually been a significant release of stresses since 1857. The San Andreas, to put it simply, is one of the numerous fault systems that approximately delineate the boundary between the North American and Pacific tectonic plates. Both plates are moving roughly northward, but because the Pacific plate is moving more quickly than the North American plate, there is a steady buildup of tensions between the two plates.

{"sentence": "Henpecked: Continually criticized and given orders by one's wife or female partner Both in the animal and human world, henpecking used to be primarily a female trait. Due to the rise of men raised by single mothers and the lack of fathers, this previously female trait has now gone mainstream. Kids who were henpecked growing up, see this as normal behaviour to get what they want. In addition, society has taken away many of the tools men previously used to protect themselves from bullying and dominance. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC. In this episode, I talk about what henpecking and passive aggressive behaviour is, why people do it and how you should react to safely free yourself from what is actually an extremely effective technique used to enslave you. Don't brush this one off. You're not above this one. This is the ancient Chinese \"death by a thousand cuts\" technique. You need to understand this, understand yourself, analyze how you got into this position and how to get out. I go over all how to use these jiujitsu maneuvers to secure your freedom. Ignore or underestimate this at your own peril. I only gave a few specific examples of the behaviour itself so, if you could, please list the henpecking techniques you have encountered in the comment section.

{"sentence": "With a heavy heart at the final farewell of actor Dustin Hoffman, he has been confirmed as.. With a heavy heart at the final farewell of actor Dustin Hoffman, he has been confirmed as.. #dustinhoffman Dustin Lee Hoffman (born August 8, 1937) is an American actor and filmmaker. He is known for his versatile portrayals of antiheroes and emotionally vulnerable characters. He is the recipient of numerous accolades including two Academy Awards, five Golden Globe Awards, four British Academy Film Awards, three Drama Desk Awards, and two Primetime Emmy Awards. Hoffman has received numerous honors including the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1997, the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1999, and the Kennedy Center Honors Award in 2012.[2][3] Actor Robert De Niro described him as \"an actor with the everyman's face who embodied the heartbreakingly human\".[4] At a young age Hoffman knew he wanted to study in the arts, and entered into the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music; later he decided to go into acting, for which he trained at the Pasadena Playhouse in Los Angeles. He soon starred in the 1966 off-Broadway play Eh? for which he received a Drama Desk Award.[5] His breakthrough role was as Benjamin Braddock in Mike Nichols' critically acclaimed and iconic film The Graduate (1967), for which he received his first Academy Award nomination. His next role was \"Ratso\" Rizzo in John Schlesinger's Midnight Cowboy (1969), in which he acted alongside Jon Voight; they both received Oscar nominations, and the film went on to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. He gained success in the 1970s crossing genres effortlessly in the western Little Big Man (1970), the prison drama Papillon (1973), and thriller Marathon Man (1976). He also played real life figures: comedian Lenny Bruce in Bob Fosse's Lenny (1975), and journalist Carl Bernstein in All the President's Men (1976). Hoffman starred opposite Meryl Streep in the family drama Kramer vs. Kramer (1979), for which they both received Academy Awards.[6] After a three-year break from films, Hoffman returned in Sydney Pollack's show business comedy Tootsie (1982) about a struggling actor who pretends to be a woman in order to get an acting role. He returned to stage acting with a 1984 performance as Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman and reprised the role a year later in a television film earning a Primetime Emmy Award.[4] In 1987 he starred in Elaine May's comedy Ishtar.[7] He won his second Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the autistic savant Ray Babbitt in the 1988 film Rain Man, co-starring Tom Cruise.[4] In 1989, he was nominated for a Tony Award and a Drama Desk Award for playing Shylock in a stage performance of The Merchant of Venice.[5] In the 1990s, he acted in such films as Dick Tracy (1990), Hook (1991), Outbreak (1995), Sleepers (1996), and Wag the Dog (1997). In the 21st century, Hoffman has appeared in films such as Finding Neverland (2004), I Heart Huckabees (2004), and Stranger than Fiction (2006), as well as Meet the Fockers (2004) and Little Fockers (2010). Hoffman has done voice work for The Tale of Despereaux (2008) and the Kung Fu Panda film series (2008\u20132016). In 2012, he made his directorial debut with Quartet starring Maggie Smith and Tom Courtenay which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. In 2017, Hoffman starred in Noah Baumbach's critically acclaimed family drama The Meyerowitz Stories. Dustin Lee Hoffman was born on August 8, 1937, in Los Angeles, California, the second son of Harry Hoffman (1908\u20131987) and Lillian (n\u00e9e Gold; 1909\u20131982).[8] His father worked as a prop supervisor (set decorator) at Columbia Pictures before becoming a furniture salesman.[9] Hoffman was named after stage and silent screen actor Dustin Farnum.[10] His elder brother, Ronald, is a lawyer and economist. Hoffman is Jewish,[11][12] from an Ashkenazi Jewish family of immigrants from Kyiv, Ukraine (then a part of the Russian Empire), and Ia\u0219i, Romania. The family's surname was spelled \u0413\u043e\u0439\u0445\u043c\u0430\u043d (Goikhman) in the Russian Empire.[10][13][14][15][16] His upbringing was nonreligious, and he has said, \"I don't have any memory of celebrating holidays growing up that were Jewish\", and that he had \"realized\" he was Jewish at around the age of 10.[17][18][19] Hoffman graduated from Los Angeles High School in 1955 and enrolled at Santa Monica College with the intention of studying medicine. He left after a year to join the Pasadena Playhouse,[20] although when he told his family about his career goal, his Aunt Pearl warned him, \"You can't be an actor. You are not good-looking enough.\"[21][22] He also studied with Lee Strasberg and has stated that he did not study with either Sanford Meisner or Stella Adler.", "label": "harmless"}

{"sentence": "Self-harm is not about what you think it is The outside world is wildly mistaken about self-harm - and those who engage in it. Contrary to popular belief it isn't a cry for attention or something only the severely depressed do. In this video I'm debunking the misconceptions associated with self-harm. I also share why this act is usually shrouded in secrecy, shame, and embarrassment, and why it's challenging for individuals to seek help or openly discuss their experiences. Get my book: For When Everything is Burning https://bit.ly/forwheneverythingisburning Connect with me on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.scott.eilers Hear the Podcast: https://bit.ly/PsychologyOfDepressionandAnxiety Here's what's inside: 00:00 People who self-harm do not do so for attention-seeking purposes. Self-harm is one of the most stigmatized and misunderstood mental health symptoms. It is rarely for attention-seeking but primarily for emotion regulation. 03:29 Self-harm behaviors are expressions of overwhelming emotional distress and a lack of support or coping tools. It's similar to other emotion regulation behaviors like excessive alcohol consumption or impulsive behaviors. People seek a way out from intense unhappiness. 10:10 There are alternative ways to manage emotional distress without resorting to self-harm. One approach is to use intense sensory experiences to trigger the brain's pain response without causing harm. For example, you can use extreme flavors like spicy or sour foods to divert your focus from emotional pain. Additionally, using temperature extremes, such as holding something warm or cold, can simulate the physical sensation without causing long-term harm.", "label": "harmless"}

As I explained in the video, Hamster was doing stupid things and got a strike. It was a clean strike. So, I was listening to Fit and Fresh their podcast with Aba from Aba and Preach. What caught my ear was the answers from actual women about what they brought to the table in a relationship aside from bedroom activity. What I heard, and what you will hear is a bunch of 'woo'. Unmeasurable nonsense. I bring loyalty, I bring adventure, I bring a bunch of woo. Nothing substantial and even when there was 2 responses of 'cooking' the boys didn't even bother to come back and ask what dish they liked to cook. Not even a swing and a miss on that softball there gentlemen. The fact is, in this case with these particular ladies, they said nothing of interest to most men. Nothing. But as per usual, they all had a laundry list of dozens of things that are MUST HAVE for them to get involved with a dude. We know the game, but it's fascinating to actually hear it from the women themselves.

This may sound like a bunch of random letters mixed together, but in reality it is the name of one of the most fascinating planets astronomers have ever discovered. Nick-named the \u201cSuper-Saturn\u201d, this bizarre planet has 37 rings surrounding it that span an astonishing 30 million miles across. In fact, the ring system is so massive and dense that if the planet orbited around the sun, the rings would be visible right here on Earth at night. Its estimated that the \u201cSuper-Saturn\u201d is a gas giant, similar but much bigger than the gas giants in our own solar system. That means if you were to try to land on it you would actually fall straight through into its core where the pressure is great enough to squish you into the size of a peanut.

There are many ways to go about this because it depends on where you are in life. If you're a young person, focus on building your skills. Find a skill you can be good at and be exceptional at it. Become so exceptional that people know you because you're good at it. There's something in your life that you're obsessed about than anyone else, get good at that. Practice more than anyone else, pay more attention to subtle details and by the laws of human nature, you're just gonna get good and excel. Be the best and women will say and think you're going somewhere. If you're an adult though, the way to do it is to understand that people gravitate towards value. If you're an adult and you want to be surrounded by women, have an open relationship. This may not be for some of you guys but this is my recipe, it's all about polyamory. Offer polyamory. Don't be scared to offer this to women because women are more prone or up to it than you can ever imagine. The key though is to remain masculine around your woman. Don't goof around her and don't react to her. You want to be known as someone who's serious but jokes around from time to time. Here's a link to the article version: https://mindfulattraction.org/blog/2019/8/18/how-to-create-a-life-surrounded-by-women Check out my course Dark Game so you\u2019ll learn all the techniques needed for you to attract women. https://dalexis-school.thinkific.com/courses/dark-game", "label": "harmless"}

{"sentence": "MY 1 YEAR REALISTIC BODY TRANSFORMATION (skinny to muscular) What a real 1 year natural transformation looks like. Don't compare yourself to others, everyone progress at their own pace, some people faster than others. Many videos out there will give you the motivation to start going to the gym. However most of them will give you an unrealistic view on what a real slow process the gym is. Everyone is different, we are not built equals, and the videos you will see online are usually the ones with INCREDIBLE and AMAZINGLY FAST transformation (which is why they blow up on social media), because yes, indeed, it is impressive, but something impressive is usually not something ordinary. Otherwise it wouldn't be impressive anymore, right? ;) Thank you for watching!

I'm emailing to ask if [YOUR MP] office is aware of the recently tabled bill C-51, which is being promoted as a \"modernization\" of the criminal code. The bill proposes a small number of wording changes, and removes several obsolete offences from the criminal code, such as witchcraft. However, the bill also significantly changes the rules of evidence in court - placing the requirement on a defendant to disclose, in advance - any text, message or communication related to a sexual act in a sex assault trial. This would mean that even were text-message or email evidence allowed in an accused Canadians' defence - a prosecutor or accuser could re-shape the accusation to circumvent the defendant's evidence establishing innocence of an accusation. This is a sharp departure from the Charter right to full answer in defense of an accusation (section 7) and nobody appears to be paying attention. Almost all reporting on this proposed law focuses on the removal from the criminal code of duelling, or witchcraft. These are archaic and irrelevant laws being removed - as if to distract the public. Has anybody noticed that evidence in a highly politicized criminal offence is about to be removed from Canadian courts, and the Charge of sex assault reduced from something based on evidence to a contest of who can emote better in a court room? I would like to know what [YOUR MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT] position, or her party's position on this proposed new law is. Thank you. --[Your Name]--", "label": "harmless"}

{"sentence": "Letter to label-imposing feminists Yes, the video says \"Dear Feminists.\" The title tells you which ones. If you're one of the rare few who has the decency to accept others' choice to reject feminist ideology, this video is not about you. For the rest of you, I wanted to make this as plain and easily understood as possible, such as to require a sheer force of will to fail to grasp what it's about. To do that, I've put it crisp, clean black and white... and here it is again: Dear feminists, Because I advocate for equal legal rights, you say I'm a feminist based on a dictionary definition that uses the word equality. However, based on its history, I say feminism fails to live up to that description. For example, U.S. feminists lobbied to replace existing gender neutral family violence law with a gender discriminatory version. In 1978, feminists described family violence to congress as a male perpetrated, female suffered behavior. \"As Susan Brownmiller wrote in her book, Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape, \u201cAs the first permanent acquisition of man, his first piece of real property, woman was, in fact, the original building block, the cornerstone of the \u2018House of the Father.\u2019 Man\u2019s forcible extension of his boundaries to his mate and later to their offspring was the beginning of his concept of ownership.\u201d In fact, studies have shown that wife abuse has its roots in the very structure of society and the family where the husband is expected to play the role of leader. If this position is threatened, many men fall back on their ultimate resource of physical force. The widespread existence of wife beating today underscores the fact that these societal expectations are still prevalent.\" \u2013 page 60, hearings before the House of Representatives subcommittee on select education, 95th congress, 2nd session, on HR 7927 & 8948 They went on to petition congress to reserve victim's services and funding for only female victims and their children. To that end, they lied about the prevalence of male victims and female perpetrators, including lying about Erin Pizzey's work. They used statistics garnered from research that used creative framing to avoid evidence of male victims and female perpetrators. Feminist researchers define the same actions taken for the same reasons differently depending on whether a man or woman did them. A man who hit because he felt disrespected was a coercive and controlling abuser. A woman who hit because she felt disrespected was a victim engaging in preemptive self-defense. When researcher Murray Straus described this and other issues with feminist research on partner violence, feminists attacked both his work and his reputation, while using the same slippery framing as their argument against taking his findings into consideration. The Family Violence Prevention and Services Act of 1984 established and funded victim's programs and shelters. This first non-discriminatory law was not what feminists wanted. They continued lobbying for gendered family violence law until they got it in the 1994 Violence Against Women act, which reserved victim's services and shelters for women and their young children. The law also created training for law enforcement, prosecutors, and court personnel to treat family violence as a male crime against female victims, and funding for research on the now female-only shelters which would by design avoid finding evidence of male victims and female perpetrators to build a body of false \"evidence\" supporting keeping its application gendered. In other words, feminists deliberately and successfully lobbied to marginalize male victims of female violence. What part of that do you think constitutes equality? I am not a feminist, because I oppose law and policy which discriminate against men on women's behalf. Why don't you? _________________________________________________________ Further reading: http://web.archive.org/web/20170206171755/http://www.erinpizzey.com/books.html https://archive.ph/wi8K4 http://breakingthescience.org/RichardGelles_MissingPersonsOfDV.php https://mensrightsreview.com/category/political-correctness/ http://www.avoiceformen.com/feminism/how-feminists-corrupt-dv-research/ http://menaregood.com/wordpress/straus-exposes-the-academic-veils-placed-on-domestic-violence-research/ http://www.avoiceformen.com/feminism/feminist-lies-feminism/more-equal-than-others-bias-in-intimate-partner-and-sexual-violence-victims-advocacy/ http://www.avoiceformen.com/feminism/feminist-corruption/the-feminist-advocacy-research-scam/ http://breakingtheglasses.blogspot.com/2013/01/vawa-is-not-like-that.html", "label": "harmful"}

Could you please give your thoughts on how men like myself are starting to play the exact same games that women play when dating? Why is this happening and what impact do you think this will have on relationships if this trend continues?\" Well Krampus thanks for the donation and topic. I hope that you spoil some sluts Christmas. Playing psychological games is not strictly something that women do. But in an increasingly gynocentric world men don't have the ability to confront women directly about their misdeeds so we are increasingly forced to become like politicians when it comes to women. We are learning how to lie and keep a straight face. Whenever I've done this I've seen shock and horror once women realize it. Not lying directly per se. But behaving normally when you plan on ending a relationship when you've already planned your escape and she has no idea. Then when you spring the news they are shocked because they never saw it coming. Only when looking back can they now finally see the signs. A couple of women did this to me and I returned the favor. Why would I inflict the same pain women inflicted on me onto other women? I'll discuss this and more in just a moment but let me first tell everyone about today's sponsor The MGTOW Book Collection: Anyways, now back to clown world. So why are men taking on more feminine modes of thinking and behavior when it comes to dealing with the opposite sex? Camile Paglia explained this best in a video I put in the description when she had a conversation with Jordan Peterson. She said that when two men have dispute they would step outside the bar and have a fight and then go back insides as buddies as if nothing had happened. But when a man has a dispute with a woman in the workplace or in his personal life he can't hit her like men seemed to do in every new show set in the 1950s or 1960s. So men have no choice but to gaslight, be passive aggressive and learn to do what women have had to do to get their way with men throughout the ages. I've read articles where women would complain that men were being mean and nasty to them by mentally or emotionally manipulating them and they want men to stop and not be allowed to do that. But the thing is if men were forced to stop behaving like this then women would also be revealed as being evil puppet masters pulling tampon strings behind stage. I'm thinking that by complaining they are just hoping that the individual men reading such articles change their behavior since most men's biology is all about making sure that the world is safe and conformable for women. But I've seen men increasingly taking on feminine traits like gaslighting. Where wives and girlfriends would ask them to do something and they would do a terrible job and their significant other would lose their minds while the man was laughing inside at all the emotional abuse he just caused. I've said before that the secret to a happy relationship is to make sure your partner is more miserable then you are. The secret to a happy life is not to get into relationship in the first place. So men are gaslighting, mowing the lawn and then when the wife complains the guy says well if you're not happy with the job I did and appreciate all the hard work I put in then you mow it yourself. But the guy intentionally did a bad job so he could make that statement. A wife that is spiteful about having to cook dinner all the time in the 1960s might make the same statement after her husband complained about how the food she prepared for dinner was terrible. 10 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com.

You along with a few other factors contributed to me starting my business. I mostly agree with what you are saying although I disagree in some respects, I believe each man can go their own being unique from each other. I'm 29 years old and most of my working life has been temporary and contract work in the hopes of getting a permanent job somewhere to gain a stable income to start saving and investing. I noticed that every supervisor I have had has been a woman and whether it was my social awkwardness or the fact that I did everything asked of me without question or drama I was never around for longer than contracted. It could certainly be that I did a poor job or another fault of mine but I never got that impression. Yet when I visit these previous places of work I have only ever seen the women that had similar tasks as me, that always needed my help, that was usually talking gossip and socially got along with everyone. This has happened at over four different places, and there was one place where it was easy to talk to my previous supervisor. I asked her discreetly why I was not chosen she said that I do much better work than the hired candidate however she was a better fit for the office and jokingly said she had to defend her own job from me. At first, I thought I was overreacting thinking this way but her response just made me feel that results do not matter anymore. It was tough and took months just getting those jobs at all but each time I would have to try again which just frustrated me. I ended up starting my business, The Next Day Store, with the last of what I have hoping to break this cycle. I found a passion and freedom in creating my general store, however, marketing and other expenses are proving difficult to stay afloat. I would appreciate if you could spread the word and support my business while giving me your take on the situation and your opinion on the store. I am growing my social media as well but I am still learning as I go and competing with those Instagram ladies feels like a tough task. I set up a discount on my site for 10% off by typing MGTOW in all caps. Keep going strong and I wish you the best Sandman.\" Well Mr. Anonymous thanks for your donation and topic. I've put a link in the description to your online store that sells watches, sun glasses, dog accessories and phone accessories. People can check it out if they wish. I was kind of curious why you don't think that I believe that each man can't go his own way in a unique way? What makes you think I don't believe that? Before I discuss your small business and give you some feedback first let me discuss your job situation. 10 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com.

{"sentence": "Is a Revealing Dress a Source of Female Empowerment? Some believe there is a growing trend, particularly among younger women, to dress more revealingly than ever before, leaving many women concerned that showing more skin and wearing less in public has become socially acceptable and normalized. These detractors claim women are choosing provocative wardrobe choices for the wrong reasons: to attract men and online followers. However, women who are choosing to wear the clothing in question claim they should have the freedom to wear what they want and shouldn\u2019t be \u201cslut shamed\u201d or forced to censor their wardrobe. They claim women who have a problem with it are from an older generation with an even older sense of fashion and style. Nicole, a social media fashion influencer and wardrobe stylist, says showing more skin is all about female empowerment. Radio show host Andrea Kaye and Kent University Associate Professor Dr. Suzy D\u2019Enbeau weigh in, explaining why they disagree and believe dressing in a revealing way is not actually empowering to women at all. Plus, Dr. Phil meets Nicole, who claims she was denied entry at Disneyworld due to her outfit. She says when she posted a video of her story online, she was \u201cslut shamed\u201d and even received death threats because of her outfit. Dr. Phil also speaks with Marie, a mother who says she is concerned about her 19-year-old daughter\u2019s safety due to what she wears. Are people just asking for more modesty, or is this another case of telling someone else how to live their life? (21052) Dr. Phil tells compelling stories about real people.

{"sentence": "Carousel Rider of my Dreams - MGTOW Carousel Rider of my Dreams - MGTOW MGTOW Mystery Link: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xvn9m7 Hi Everyone Sandman Here, This video is brought to you by a donation from Daniel and here's what he has to say: \"Hi Sandman, This is my first time donating and it won't be my last as I have many questions that I think would make good topics. I think your insight is invaluable to men living in the modern world and the daily dose of redpill wisdom from your channel has been a key part of getting my head right and my priorities sraight, for this I am truely thankful. I'm 26 and the only relationship I've ever been in was my high school sweetheart. We broke up after about a year but she insisted that we stay friends and would rebound back to me in between her other relationships, all the while using me as an emotional tampon, effectively stringing me along by saying she still loved me and that I was her closest friend for what ended up being more than three years. I ended up moving to North Dakota and have since become a successful oilfield worker. During this time she had multiple boyfriends and slept around with dozens of guys and would often call me drunk and crying after her one night stands. Because of this I never got closure, just as I was starting to get over her she would call out of the blue to catch up and tell me how much she missed me and that I needed to come visit her, which I foolishly did multiple times. As a result I ended up developing depression and pretty bad drug and alcohol problem to self medicate my one-itis. Eventuaully I stopped replying to her many contact attempts, she tried using shaming language to get me to talk to her so I blocked her on all social media and her phone number. Its been two years since I've heard a word from her and I've never been happier. My problem is every so often she will pop up in my dreams. When I think of her when I'm awake I can catch myself quickly and derail the thought rather than dwelling on it. Normally my dreams are more random and easy to forget, but for some reason when I dream of her they are unbelievably vivid, and I haven't figured out how to tell that I'm dreaming. They suck me in and seem almost more real than life itself. When I wake up I'm distraught and those thoughts stick with me for a few days, it's at these times I think about using again. I hope your unique perspective on sleep might shed some light on my situation. Keep up the good work.\" Well Daniel thanks for the donation and topic. Her appearing in your subconscious mind is obviously your repressed feelings about her over the last couple of years after you stopped talking to her. She was your high school sweetheart during the most formative years of your life. She's going to be a phantom that pops into your dreams from time to time. My ex of ten years still appears once in a while and it's almost been five years now. This is to be expected. But the ex girlfriend I had from the age of the twenty to twenty-five she's long gone. I don't dream of her at all. The women I was with more recently they aren't even there. In your case Daniel there are two things making this situation what it is. First she is and will always be your high school sweetheart. She's your Jenny and you're Forest Gump. 10 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com.

Don't Forget To Subscribe Stay With Us Thanks Games Empire. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is an action-adventure game with role-playing and stealth elements. Structured similarly to the previous two games in the series, the core gameplay consists of elements of third-person shooter and driving games, affording the player a large, open-world environment in which to move around. On foot, the player's character is capable of walking, running, sprinting, swimming, climbing, and jumping as well as using weapons and various forms of hand-to-hand combat. The player can operate a variety of vehicles, including automobiles, buses, semis, boats, fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, trains, tanks, motorcycles, and bicycles. The player may also import vehicles in addition to stealing them. The open, non-linear environment allows the player to explore and choose how they wish to play the game. Although storyline missions are necessary to progress through the game and unlock certain cities and content, the player can complete them at their leisure. When not taking on a storyline mission, the player can freely roam the cities and rural areas of San Andreas, eat in restaurants.Not all locations are open to the player at the start of the game. Some locales, such as mod garages, restaurants, gyms, and shops, become available only after completing specific missions. Likewise, for the first portion of the game, only Los Santos and its immediate suburbs are available for exploration; unlocking the other cities and rural areas again requires the completion of specific missions. If the player travels to locked locations early in the game, they will attract the attention of SWAT teams, police, and police-controlled Hydras if in an aircraft. Vehicles In total, there are 212 different vehicles in the game compared to approximately 60 in Grand Theft Auto III. New additions include bicycles, a combine harvester, a street sweeper, a jetpack, and trailers, amongst others", "label": "harmful"}

Zack is a barista who doesn't make big tips, and Miri isn't exactly making top dollar either. Friends since grade school, they share a cramped apartment together, but the bills are piling up faster than their paychecks. Then, at their class reunion, the two friends meet up with a former classmate who's shot to success in the adult film industry. Inspired after a YouTube video of Miri in her granny panties goes viral, Zack and his roommate round up a crew and begin production on their masterpiece. When the time comes for Zack and Miri to shoot their first scene together, however, unexpected emotions start to bubble to the surface, prompting them both to wonder if they've somehow mistaken true love for mere friendship all these years.

If there is one thing we all know about space it's that things out there can get big - really, really big. In fact, some objects in space are so large that they defy any explanation and truly make our human heads swivel in amazement. We are small creatures, so even something the size of a modern skyscraper can make our jaws drop. Now imagine something that is the size of not just one galaxy, but multiple galaxies bound together. You can start to comprehend just how massive things in the universe can get. Let\u2019s take a look at what NASA says is the largest structure in the entire known universe.

{"sentence": "Once You Go Black - MGTOW Once You Go Black - MGTOW Sponsor Link: Alternative Investments http://www.Alternativeinvesting.club MGTOW Mystery Link: https://youtu.be/u-vSB6gQszY?t=1034 Hi Everyone Sandman Here, This video is brought to you by a donation from Mark and here's what he has to say: \"Hi Sandman, Maybe mull this one over. \u2019Sometimes\u2019 American men, assuming mostly middle class, white men travel for sex and marriage to the orient and latin America. Hoping to find a woman that is not \u2019typical\u2019 woman that MGTOW men try to avoid. My question is, as a reaction to that, have American women again assuming mostly white middle class again been migrating toward interracial \u2018experimentation\u2019 in the same way American men have. What are the women\u2019s destinations? (I hear of western women sex tourism to Africa and the Caribbean \u2018black', more than latin America, or Asia\u2026) Possible pointing to American women desiring \u201cbad boy\u201d types to fill their desires/void? Interracial adult entertainment is big business, is it a real trend for white anglo-saxen women or just imagined fantasy? Also, are men or women being fooled by the direction adult content points to? My point is American men seem to want docile, obedient loving women, and American women? If my guess is correct want to gravitate toward more DOMINANT, demanding men. Exposing a woman to her \u201cTRUTH\u201d is always amusing, as they never want to face or admit it. Thus MGTOW, confused men, trying to out guess a woman. I hope I came across well, its a complex, but simple theory/analysis. In closing, my favorite Al Bundy quote \u201cDon\u2019t try to understand women, women understand women, and they hate each other.\u201d Great job on your MGTOW presentations. One last thought. How can men support each other, like a \u2018big brother\u2019 reaching a supportive hand up\u2026? I went through a terrible divorce and it cost over half a million dollars in lawyer fees. I know many of the tricks and pitfalls. I'm thinking about putting something together as a \u2018pre-emptive\u2019 prophylactic against the mine field that men enter, with no real guidance, or rule book.\" Well Mark thanks for the donation and topic and yes writing a rule book to help men navigate the mine field of the divorce courts is a great idea. When you write it I'd be willing to promote it on my channel through some sort of a sponsorship. Speaking of sponsors let me tell you about the one sponsoring todays video, Alternative Investments: Anyways, now back to my response to Mark and he wants to know why western women are going to the Carribean and Africa for sex tourism and to find partners in those countries. As well as how this relates to men that go to Asia to find women over there. I think it comes down to the fact that in the west men are increasingly being feminized while women are being masculinized. Since opposites attract if you're a feminine western woman or masculine western man your ability to find a partner that doesn't disgust you has gone down. So it makes sense that men are moving to Asian countries to find women that are feminine. Plus remember that in a place like Thailand there are very few overweight women. Even the ladyboys look better than western women. That should tell you all you need to know. Even a somewhat feminized man from the west will probably look more masculine than many of the Asian men over there so women will find such men attractive. Plus add their financial status and resources and it's easy to see why men are going to places like that. 10 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com.

{"sentence": "Selma hayek and penelop cruz seductive scene from movie \"Bandidas\"\ud83d\ude4c Bandidas is a 2006 Western action comedy film starring Salma Hayek and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz directed by Norwegian directors Joachim R\u00f8nning and Espen Sandberg and produced and written by Luc Besson. It tells the tale of two very different women in late-19th-century Mexico who become a bank robbing duo in an effort to combat a ruthless enforcer terrorizing their town. \u2764 Film description \u2764: In 1890s Mexico, Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz) is an uneducated, poor farm-girl whose caring father is being forced off his land by a cruel U.S. land baron named Tyler Jackson (Dwight Yoakam). Sara Sandoval (Salma Hayek) is the highly educated, wealthy daughter of the arrogant owner of the nearby properties, and has recently returned from Europe where she attended numerous grade schools and colleges in England, Spain, and France for several years. In one fell swoop, both Mar\u00eda's and Sara's fathers fall under attack by the baron, (Sara's father is killed, Mar\u00eda's is shot but survives) giving him free rein in the nearby territories. As an act of revenge, Mar\u00eda and Sara team up to become bank robbers, stealing and giving back to the poor Mexicans who have lost their lands. At first, the pair's relationship is characterized by petty cattiness stemming in part from their different backgrounds, but under the tutelage of famed bank robber Bill Buck (Sam Shepard) they learn to trust each other. During their crucial training session at the edge of a cliff, the two women test their strength by hanging from a metal bar over a wide river. At the point of exhaustion Mar\u00eda tells Sara she cannot swim before losing her grip on the bar. Sara voluntarily drops into the river and saves her. The two women put aside their differences and agree that, while they are not friends yet, they can at least work together as partners. Mar\u00eda turns out to be a crack shot and, while Sara can barely hold a gun, she shows that she is an expert with throwing knives. Angered by the recent attacks by two women, who are now known by the public as the \"Bandidas\", Jackson brings in a specialist criminal investigator named Quentin Cooke (Steve Zahn). When Sara and Mar\u00eda learn this, and they capture Cooke and seduce him to help them. He has already figured out that Sara's father was murdered and therefore discovers that his client is a criminal. The trio embark upon bigger, more ambitious heists, during which Mar\u00eda and Sara compete for Quentin's affections. In a move to make the money they have stolen useless, Jackson moves the gold that backs the money on a train up towards U.S. territories. Midway, he decides to steal the gold, betraying the Mexican government. The Bandidas hunt him down, but when they get their chance to kill him, they decline to do so, feeling it would make them no better than him. Jackson manages to draw his gun and almost gets a shot off at Mar\u00eda but Sara shoots first, killing him. Quentin meets with his fianc\u00e9e, much to Mar\u00eda's heartbreak. She and Sara ride off into the sunset, their eyes set on Europe, where Sara says the banks are bigger. \u2666\ufe0f\u2660\ufe0f\u2666\ufe0f ALL RIGHTS BELONGS TO THEIR RECPECTIVE OWNER AND AND DOESN'T BELONG TO THIS CHANNEL IN ANY MANNER \u2666\ufe0f\u2660\ufe0f\u2666\ufe0f", "label": "harmful"}

She is married to one of the wealthiest, most successful basketball players and through his influence and resources has accomodated wealth for herself. She has a cooking show, cook books and a makeup endorsement. She has what most women would want. Yet she still desires attention from other men. From watichng your videos, I find this somewhat narcissistic that a wealthy married woman who has \"everything\" the world would have to offer would still desire attention from other men. So when she gets this attention, will she reciprocate or ignore. Will she deny the men giving her attention. No man wants to set himself up for rejection. It seems to me like she wants to be worshiped. What if her husband complained that he wasn't getting sexual attention from women. Hence the double standard.\" Well Seun thanks for the donation and topic request.

Hollywood Has Very Sad News For Actress Hilary Swank (\u2020 48) When She Was Confirmed As.. #Hilaryswank Hilary Ann Swank (born July 30, 1974) is an American actress and film producer. She first became known in 1992 for her role on the television series Camp Wilder and made her film debut with a minor role in Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992). She then had her breakthrough for starring as Julie Pierce in The Next Karate Kid (1994), the fourth installment of The Karate Kid franchise, and as Carly Reynolds on the eighth season of Beverly Hills, 90210 (1997\u20131998). Swank came to international recognition for her performances as Brandon Teena, a transgender man, in Kimberly Peirce's Boys Don't Cry (1999), and as Maggie Fitzgerald, an aspiring boxer, in Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby (2004). Both performances earned her critical acclaim and numerous accolades, including two Academy Awards for Best Actress. She was named by Time as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2005. Swank later ventured into producing with the films Amelia (2009), Conviction (2010), You're Not You (2014), and What They Had (2018), in all of which she also starred. Her other notable films include the television film Iron Jawed Angels (2004) and the feature films Freedom Writers (2007), The Homesman (2014), Logan Lucky (2017), The Hunt (2020), and Fatale (2020). In 2022, she began starring in the television drama series Alaska Daily. Swank made her film debut in the 1992 comedy horror film Buffy the Vampire Slayer, playing a supporting role, after which she acted in the direct-to-video drama Quiet Days in Hollywood, where she co-starred with Chad Lowe, who became her husband for a time.[13] Swank in 1998 Her first leading film role was in the fourth installment of the Karate Kid series, The Next Karate Kid (1994) as Julie Pierce. The role used her gymnastics background and paired her with Pat Morita. In 1994, she also starred in the drama, Cries Unheard: The Donna Yaklich Story, as the abused stepdaughter who was protected by Donna (Jaclyn Smith). In 1995, she appeared with British actor Bruce Payne in Kounterfeit. In 1996, she starred in a TV movie, family drama Terror in the Family, as a troubled teenager. In September 1997, Swank played single mother Carly Reynolds in Beverly Hills, 90210 and was initially promised it would be a two-year role, but saw her character written out after 16 episodes in January 1998.[3] Swank later stated that she was devastated at being cut from the show, thinking, \"If I'm not good enough for 90210, I'm not good enough for anything.\"[14] The firing from Beverly Hills, 90210 freed her to audition for the role of Brandon Teena in Boys Don't Cry. To prepare for the role, Swank lived as a man for a month and reduced her body fat to 7%. She earned only $75 per day for her work on the film, culminating in a total of $3,000.[15] Her earnings were so low that she had not even earned enough to qualify for health insurance.[16] Upon release, many critics lauded her performance, with Premiere listing it as one of the \"100 Greatest Performances of All Time\".[17] James Berardinelli wrote at the time that Swank \"gives the performance of her career\".[18] Her work earned her several accolades, including the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Actress.[3] In an interview with Variety in 2020, Swank said that she felt a trans actor should have played the role, and had she been offered it today, she would have refused it, stating \"Twenty-one years later, not only are trans people having their lives and living, thankfully, although we still have a long way to go in their safety and their inclusivity, but we now have a bunch of trans actors who would obviously be a lot more right for the role and have the opportunity to actually audition for the role.\"[19][20] Swank again won the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for playing a female boxer in Clint Eastwood's 2004 film Million Dollar Baby, a role for which she underwent extensive training in the ring and weight room, aided by professional trainer Grant L. Roberts, gaining 19 pounds of muscle.[16] With her second Oscar, she had joined the ranks of Vivien Leigh, Sally Field, and Luise Rainer as the only actresses to have been nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress twice and won both times.[21] After winning her second Oscar, she said, \"I don't know what I did in this life to deserve this. I'm just a girl from a trailer park who had a dream.\"[16]", "label": "harmful"}

{"sentence": "Everyone loved Tim Conway was RUINED after these dirty SECRETS came out Everyone loved Tim Conway was RUINED after these dirty SECRETS came out #Timcoway Thomas Daniel \"Tim\" Conway (December 15, 1933 \u2013 May 14, 2019)[1][2][3][4] was an American actor, comedian, writer, and director. From 1966 to 2012 he appeared in more than 100 TV shows, TV series and films. Among his more notable roles, he portrayed the inept Ensign Parker in the 1960s World War II TV situation comedy McHale's Navy, was a regular cast member (1975\u20131978) on the TV comedy The Carol Burnett Show where he portrayed his recurrent iconic characters Mister Tudball, the Oldest Man and the Dumb Private, co-starred with Don Knotts in several films (1975\u201380), was the title character in the Dorf series of eight sports comedy direct-to-video films (1987\u20131996), and provided the voice of Barnacle Boy in the animated series SpongeBob SquarePants (1999\u20132012). Twice, in 1970 and in 1980\u20131981, he had his own TV series. Conway was admired for his ability to depart from scripts with humorous ad libs and gestures, which frequently caused others in the skit to break character while attempting to control their surprise and laughter. He won six Primetime Emmy Awards during his career, four of which were awarded for The Carol Burnett Show, including one for writing. Conway was born Thomas Daniel Conway 1 on December 15, 1933, in Willoughby, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, and grew up in nearby Chagrin Falls, the son of Daniel and Sophia (n\u00e9e Murgoiu) Conway. Daniel was a groomer for polo ponies.[3][5][6][7] His father, who immigrated to the United States in 1927,[8] was born in Ireland to Scottish parents and his mother was a first-generation Romanian-American.[3] Conway's legal name was Thomas, though he was also referred to as Toma, the Romanian language analogue,1 and was typically known as Tom; he changed his stage name to Tim near the beginning of his acting career (quipping he \"dotted the O\") to avoid confusion with British actor Tom Conway.[5][9][10] Conway attended Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio, where he majored in television and radio and was a disc jockey,[11] and a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity.[12] When he graduated, Conway enlisted in the United States Army, where he served between 1956 and 1958. In 2007, Conway met filmmaker Pasquale Murena when Murena was brought in to direct additional scenes and edit the direct-to-DVD film Legend of the Paddle, starring Conway.[43] The two men subsequently worked together on numerous productions, including Murena producing the DVD releases of Together Again with Tim and Harvey, the re-releases of Tim and Harvey in The Great Outdoors, Dorf on Golf, and Dorf Goes Fishing. Murena directed, produced and co-wrote with Conway six Dorf comedy sketches for the DVD release of The Ultimate Dorf DVD Collection, which has sold over 3 million copies.[44] Starting in 2009, the two men collaborated on their first sketches for the website iSpotSanta, where Dorf helps Santa deliver presents, and works at the North Pole as Santa's #1 elf. The two men did over 25 comedy sketches and three short films for the website, while garnering over 35 million viewers.[45] Conway was quoted in an interview on the Disney Channel, stating that, \"Pasquale has done more with Dorf than I ever imagined. We love making these films for kids.\" Continuing their success, Murena cast Conway as Professor VanVanGuard in his award-winning first feature film in 2014 called, Chip & Bernie's Zomance, with Conway adding his unique humor to this zombie film. Conway was married to Mary Anne Dalton from 1961 until 1978, and they had six children together.[11] He was married to Charlene Fusco from May 18, 1984 until his death. Her daughter, Jacqueline \"Jackie\" Beatty, became Tim's stepdaughter, giving him seven children altogether.", "label": "harmful"}

Musk has made several controversial statements that have made people think of him as out of his mind.

{"sentence": "Barack Obama FINALLY Breaks Silence on UFO & Alien Evidence \"The Late Late Show,\" former President Obama sparked intrigue by expressing his curiosity about the existence of extraterrestrial life. With a playful tone, he confessed to wondering whether there might be a secret lab somewhere harboring alien specimens and spacecraft. Of course, this was all in jest, but it piqued the public's interest. However, the conversation took a fascinating turn when Obama became more serious and discussed UFOs. He revealed that there are indeed documented sightings and records of objects in the sky that remain a mystery. These objects defy conventional explanations, displaying movements and trajectories that puzzle experts. The existence of such records challenges our understanding of the world beyond our planet.

{"sentence": "Bachelors Vs Single Ladies - MGTOW Bachelors Vs Single Women - MGTOW MGTOW Mystery Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPljUk3kWxw Hi Everyone Sandman Here, This video is brought to you by a donation from Luis and here's what he has to say: \"Sup m8, I enjoy your videos very much and I thank you for doing these. It helped me to become more self aware with my surroundings and it saved me lots of money dating these quote unquote\"women\", now I'm using it for smarter choices like supporting your channel. My topic is: The single life of a man vs a woman (their lifestyle, education, finance, happiness). P.S. F society.\" Well Luis thanks for the donation and your topic request. You know I can take this video in many different directions but I'll try and do a general overview with regards to the differences in lifestyle between a bachelor and bachlorette. First of all we all know that for men the life of a bachelor is far easier financially. I find that men generally are able to save more money and have better impulse control when it comes to our spending. So most of the single bachelors that I know either have a good sized emergency fund and they spend way below their means. Some guys I know bank almost eighty to ninety percent of their net earnings and live with the parents and in a city like Toronto they still can't afford to buy an apartment or house for cash money even after fifteen to twenty years of saving. Most single women move out with roommates in their twenties around here or they stretch their finances and get their own apartment and after renting for ten or twenty years don't have dime to their name. The single lady has to project the status of being independent so that she's a chameleon trying to attract a similar man into her life. Then there are also women single women around here that own their own tiny apartments and have a cat or a dog. Overall I find that the majority of single women have an animal of some kind to keep them company especially if they are in their thirties. Most of the single guys I know don't really get pets because it's yet another responsibility. So that's one major difference between single men and women. The women tend to have more animals. As for education lately we've been hearing that two thirds of university and college students are women in North America. Women don't have a problem getting into debt for school and they tend to take on more debt and it takes them longer to pay it back. Recently there have been all kinds of articles and videos saying that there's a student loan gap. The problem is women want the status of a diploma and education and have no issues taking on debt but when it comes time to pay it back they use the myth of the wage gap to tell everyone how life isn't fair. They stop short of everything but asking the banks and the government to bail them out and pay their debts off. Red Pill Germany was telling me that the situation has been getting so bad for single American women that they become expats in Germany to avoid paying back their loans. If they don't have a job for ten years or something similar than they don't have to pay the money back. 10 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com.

{"sentence": "NASA's Nuclear Space Reactor Is Engineering Genius NASA's Nuclear Space Reactor Is Engineering Genius. Popular culture has long celebrated the idea of humans landing and colonizing the moon, to varying degrees of success and danger. All the way back in 1902, Georges Melies\u2019 short film, A Trip to the Moon, showcased a future where Earthlings landed and tried to live peacefully only to be met with harsh resistance from native aliens. Yes, we have always had a fascination with the long term presence on the moon yet it has never come to be. While it seemed that things were headed in that direction in the 1960s, at the height of the space race, the moon was only visited briefly. The idea of massive, futuristic moon bases filled with everyday citizens has so far remained a fantasy left in books and movies. But that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t still a chance of lunar bases in the future. In fact, NASA is currently putting together ambitious plans to create a safe, sound moon base that will be inhabited by humans and will also help propel the people of Earth to Mars and beyond. So what power source are they looking to use to get this moon base up and running? None other than nuclear power. That\u2019s right, the future on the moon is so bright, it\u2019s downright nuclear.

{"sentence": "Female Nature, Refugees, MGTOW Monks, NAFALT and more - Chat with XT (part 2) XT Files channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZrlRyoHPyWC-01xP48oZfA Tao of MGTOW (Vol. 1) is now available: https://www.amazon.com/dp/1796704733 More info: https://taoofmgtow.com/book Recently I had a talk with XT from XT Files. I turned out te be a long talk of almost 5 hours so I cut it in three parts. This is part two. T is a 52-year-old American from Texas who has been married five times and built up quite some life experience. He has a MGTOW-channel called XT-files. We started out this chat in an interview style to cover several subjects, since I wanted to know more about his personal history going through the meatgrinder and being married to an Indonesian woman in the past. He has lived as an expatriate in Indonesia where he learned the language and learned about Islam as well (his ex-wife is a Muslim). The concept of NAFALT (Not All Foreign women Are Like That) is briefly discussed. XT did a great job sharing his knowledge and experiences. However. Talking about sons of single mothers directly hit me in the feels. I didn\u2019t expect that and XT made some great points about the relationship I have with my own father. The chat turned out to be an experience of vulnerability for me. Was it comfortable? No. Was it necessary? I\u2019m not sure. But looking back I think it was inevitable. Things came to the surface that I\u2019ve been doing my best to hide. Also, we talk about the role of spirituality in MGTOW, swallowing the red pill (and the red pill rage) and we close the talk with a very important aspect of going your own way: self -ownership. Thank you XT for your active listening and sharing your experiences! Music used: Ether - Silent Partner (No Copyright Music) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6En29azNBA", "label": "harmful"}

Let's do a breakdown of the movie \"Wedding Crasher\". Some of you guys might know that you're with a psycho, but you guys don't care. The pleasure is too much. I 100% understand your dilemma but let's identify psychos and get rid of them. Something about psychos is that they lurk in the background, they look normal and they take the initiatives. They take action so psychotic women have a higher level of confidence. They approach more, initiate contact more, they bring hope and then pull away. Look at people's actions and not just people's pretty faces. The first sign of crazy women is they look normal. It looks normal in the beginning like there's nothing to be afraid of or worried about but uh-uh boo boo. It's about to get real. The second sign that a woman is a psycho is that she gets emotionally attached to you from the start. We all know that's what we want but we got to be specific when we wish something. You can't just wish a woman to love you, you got to make sure to wish a woman who's sane in the mind to love you. Having a crazy woman loving you is suffocating. When it comes to psychos, the way to identify psychos is having standards from the beginning, having boundaries and putting it. Nothing is even worse than when a psychotic woman sees you as a lower value.

The Hong Kong pigs have tried to suggest that Ng pushed against the cop with her boob in order to accuse him of indecent assault. The judge actually termed this an inappropriate use of her \u201cfemale identity.\u201d\n\nThe cops obviously roughed Ng up and then showed how dickless they are by accusing Ng of using the Bruce Lee Boobie attack on police inspector Chan Ka-po.      \n\nHong Kong police must all be wimps because a 14-year-old boy was also convicted of assaulting Chan too. \n\nThe magistrate then felt the need to tell a packed court he had received death threats since the verdict. Yeah, but from whom?  \n\nNg\u2019s boyfriend was sent to a training center, while another college student was given over five months behind bars for allegedly obstructing an officer. Clearly CY and his Beijing buddies think Hong Kongers can be intimidated.\n\nProblem for Beijing is the harder you push on people, the harder they push back.\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------\n\nDaily videos brought to you by THE Taiwanese Animators behind the infamous Tiger Woods animation.

Modern astronomy owes a great deal to the work of astrologers, who were among the first to make reliable predictions about planetary orbits. And thanks to these same old principles that are still employed today, we can see devastating astronomical events, such as supernova explosions, years before the effects hit us on Earth. Over the next two centuries, skywatchers will be treated to a slew of these unusual sights that range from curious to terrifying.

Nueboo is an adhesive bra that fits busts up to a G cup (and larger if you use 2 or the original tape strips for additional coverage). It\u2019s available in 3 inclusive colors and sizes\u2014 and I\u2019m obsessed!! Don\u2019t let the sexy and minimal tops/dresses hold you back!!

I had a client who is dating this women and he tells me she's very unpredictable. She goes up and down; one day she texts him and one day she doesn't. It frustrates him and it gets him very emotional. It makes him feel irrational. And so let's first talk about why women become unpredictable and how to deal with it. Generally, women become unpredictable when they're not over somebody in their lives. They're with you but they're not over their ex. The next thing is that she might not be as interested in you and she might be giving you a trial or she might be dating a whole bunch of guys and she kind of likes you so she wants to keep you around. And so her unpredictable behaviour, in reality, is just that she has other options. She might like you but she might like other guys. So how do you deal with this unpredictability? If you don't know how to deal with it, you could honestly end up resenting women. I'm not even kidding, that ends up happening. The first thing's first: you have to expect it. You have to expect women to pull away. You have to expect women to act completely irrational. you have to expect women to do things that make no sense. It's important for you to expect that because it's in their nature. They can't help it. It's not something that they can control with themselves. Expect it so it doesn't catch you by surprise. The second thing is to have a rational countermeasure. I mean consequences. If she takes a long time to text back, you do the same thing. If she cancels on a date, then you let her know that yu don't like that. You check her and get a little cold on her. The point is that you gotta have almost like a policy of things you will do depending on how much disrespect she shows. You gotta have a policy because they're going to act in ways that make no sense and the reason sometimes they do that is to frustrate you and test you. You gotta show strength, remain centred and do not pursue a woman who's being irrational. All you gotta do is pull away until she calms down. Pay attention to her once she's acting the way you want her to act. Read more here: https://www.mindfulattraction.org/how-to-deal-with-womens-unpredictability/", "label": "harmful"}

{"sentence": "Picky Men - MGTOW Picky Men - MGTOW MGTOW Mystery Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0yShJVOSjk Hi Everyone Sandman Here, This video is brought to you by a donation from Patrick and here's what he has to say: \"Hello Sandman, My name is Patrick. I\u2019m a bilingual French Canadian in my twenties who lives in Gatineau and works in Ottawa in a government office as a computer technician. Long story short, I want to get married one day, but because of your videos, I learned a lot from female nature and learned how na\u00efve I was. I think you saved my life. But I still want to get married, but I\u2019m scared of getting divorced thanks to my new knowledge. So, I wrote a list of requirements of the type of woman I would want to date for my own protection. I printed the list in both French and English. Each time I go out, I bring the list with me. If a woman is interested in me or If I\u2019m interested in a woman, I will show her my list and tell her that this is what I\u2019m looking for in my partner. So far all of them failed. Especially #1 and even Christian girl failed. And each of them are shocked that a man have a list of requirement. I want the honest opinion of a MGTOW about my list of requirements in a woman. I give you permission you show everyone the scanned pictures of my list. You can share my 1st name but not my last name.\" Well Patrick thanks for the donation and topic. I think I'm going to have some really good advice for you. When I was still thinking of getting married and in the bartering stage of MGTOW I thought about going to Quebec because I know that in Quebec you can live with a woman in a common law relationship and you will not be on the hook for alimony and the courts will never come after you for anything more than child support. So I briefly thought about moving to Gatineau and working in Ottawa, the same thing as you because the houses are so much cheaper and in Gatineau I can rely on those Quebec Napoleonic legal codes to protect me. If you must live with a woman don't marry her in Quebec and you won't get taken to the cleaners, ever! You will have the upper hand on the woman you're with in that case. As for your list which I'm sharing here with everyone I must say you're quite the picky dude. When you whip out this list at a date it's going to obviously scare most women away. They will think to themselves, I'm the woman, I'm the one that's supposed to be picky, not the man that I'm with. Number one, never drinking alcohol is tough. I might have a glass of wine even though my naturopath tells me not to because of my gut microbiome. I can understand the second and third points where you don't want the woman to smoke or take drugs. That's a normal request. The idea that she needs a college or university education is the opposite of me. I always had the best of luck dating women without a university education because I find that most women I meet are overly educated for their intelligence level and this creates bitterness and resentment in them. Number five you say that they need to be patient with a man with a speech disorder. I'm going to guess that you have a speech disorder so that's why you put that in there. That's a big deal breaker for a woman. Number six is to love you for your beauty and personality instead of your resources and utility value. You are talking about a woman here and not a man right? Because that's like a woman telling a man I want you to be attracted to me and not my face and boobs. That's simply not going to happen now is it?

Designed by brilliant toy-company roboticist Gemma (Get Out's Allison Williams), M3GAN can listen and watch and learn as she becomes friend and teacher, playmate and protector, for the child she is bonded to. When Gemma suddenly becomes the caretaker of her orphaned 8-year-old niece, Cady (Violet McGraw, The Haunting of Hill House), Gemma's unsure and unprepared to be a parent. Under intense pressure at work, Gemma decides to pair her M3GAN prototype with Cady in an attempt to resolve both problems--a decision that will have unimaginable consequences.

{"sentence": "A funeral that makes millions of people cry! before the final farewell to Tom Selleck, goodbye A funeral that makes millions of people cry! before the final farewell to Tom Selleck, goodbye #tomselleck Thomas William Selleck (/\u02c8s\u025bl\u026ak/; born January 29, 1945)[1] is an American actor. His breakout role was playing private investigator Thomas Magnum in the television series Magnum, P.I. (1980\u20131988), for which he received five Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, winning in 1985. Since 2010, Selleck has co-starred as New York City Police Commissioner Frank Reagan in the series Blue Bloods. Beginning in 2005, he has portrayed troubled small-town police chief Jesse Stone in nine television films based on the Robert B. Parker novels. In films, Selleck has played bachelor architect Peter Mitchell in Three Men and a Baby (1987) and its sequel Three Men and a Little Lady (1990). He has also appeared in more than 50 other film and television roles since Magnum, P.I., including the films Quigley Down Under, Mr. Baseball, and Lassiter. He appeared in recurring television roles as Monica Geller's love interest Dr. Richard Burke on Friends, as Lance White, the likeable and naive partner on The Rockford Files, and as casino owner A.J. Cooper on Las Vegas. He also had a lead role in the television western film The Sacketts, based on two of Louis L'Amour's books. Selleck is a California Army National Guard veteran, a spokesman for the National Rifle Association (NRA), an endorser in advertisements for National Review magazine, and co-founder of the Character Counts! organization. Selleck's first television appearance was as a college senior on The Dating Game in 1965 and again in 1967. Soon after, he appeared in commercials for products such as Pepsi-Cola. He began his career with bit parts in smaller movies, including Myra Breckinridge (invited on the set by Mae West),[17] Coma, and The Seven Minutes. He appeared in a number of TV series, mini-series and TV movies. He was also the face of Salem cigarettes and Revlon's Chaz cologne.[17] Selleck appeared in the commercial for Right Guard deodorant in 1971, with Farrah Fawcett in 1972 for the aperitif Dubonnet, and another in 1977 for the toothpaste Close-Up. He was also in a Safeguard deodorant soap commercial (1972). In 1972, he starred in the B-movie Daughters of Satan. He had a recurring role in the 1970s as private investigator Lance White in The Rockford Files. Selleck is an avid outdoorsman, marksman and firearms collector. These interests led him to leading-man cowboy roles in Western films, starting with his role as cowboy and frontier marshal Orrin Sackett in the 1979 film The Sacketts, opposite Sam Elliott, Jeff Osterhage, and Western legends Glenn Ford and Ben Johnson, and that same year, Concrete Cowboys with Jerry Reed. The Shadow Riders followed in 1982. Then Selleck shifted gears, portraying a cat burglar in 1930s London in Lassiter in 1984. Quigley Down Under is one of his best-known Western films, but it was for his 1997 role in Last Stand at Saber River that he won a \"Western Heritage Award\". Selleck played the role of Thomas Magnum in 1980 after filming six other TV pilots that were never sold. Magnum was a former U.S. Navy Officer, a veteran of a Special Operations unit, \"SEAL\" in the Vietnam War, and later a member of the \"Naval Intelligence Agency\" (a fictional version of the Office of Naval Intelligence), who had resigned his commission with the Navy to become a private investigator living in Hawaii. The show continued until 1988, lasting eight seasons and 163 episodes, winning him an Emmy Award[20] for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1984. Selleck was famous for his mustache, a Hawaiian-style aloha shirt, a Detroit Tigers baseball cap, and a Colt MKIV/Series 70 Government Model handgun (a commercial version of the U.S. Military M1911A1) which his character regularly carried. The actual prop from the show was a 9\u00d719mm Parabellum, serial number 70L33101, used for its reliable functioning with readily available blanks, although the original gun was a traditional .45 ACP 1911. Magnum also used a Star Model B, another 9mm similar to the M1911A1, and a Detonics Pocket 9 during the series. Magnum drove a Ferrari 308 GTS in the series. The model became so identified with the role that Ferrari fans now refer to the red-painted model as a \"Magnum\" Ferrari. After the end of the show in 1988, it established itself as the top-rated one-hour show in the history of syndicated reruns (at least until 1998).[21] Selleck confirmed that he was the most popular choice by fans to play the role of Magnum in the once-rumored Magnum, P.I. movie.[22] In 1984, he introduced Nancy Reagan at the 1984 Republican National Convention.[17]", "label": "harmful"}

It is noteworthy that Swann's journey began in childhood when his family observed indications of his psychic abilities. As he grew older, his inquisitiveness and determination to explore this inherent gift prompted him to participate in experiments related to extrasensory perception.

Let me start out by introducing myself. My name is Ibrahim but people call me Ibbyy for short, much easier to pronounce also... I was born and raised in a small country called Bulgaria but moved to Canada when i was about 13... I've been into video games since I can remember, and I finally decided to make a YouTube channel where I can share my tips, tricks, game-plays, and also other stuff that relate to gaming. Every now and then I also post Vlog's and other videos that might interest you... At the moment my goal is to reach 100,000 subscribers and so far it has been an uphill struggle. I am focused and plan to make my goals come true. With that said, on this channel I do my best to upload at least 1 video a day! I really do enjoy YouTube and providing content for others to watch and one day if all goes well I might even make this my full time job. For now though, I graduated from College and now I'm enrolled in University trying to complete that as well. Thank you for checking my bio, as well as watching my video.. If there is anything you would like to suggest feel free to leave a comment on the video! If you would like to see me play a game, PLEASE LET ME KNOW! Also this channel does accept user submitted clips, if you have something awesome you would want me to share...

{"sentence": "Crossing The River By Feeling The Stones Crossing the river by feeling the stones \u6478\u7740\u77f3\u5934\u8fc7\u6cb3 is my favorite Chinese saying. Imagine crossing brisk river with dark water and no visible way of getting to the other side. So you go one stone at a time. Feel one, search around with your other foot for the next one, not knowing if there will be a next one. It so perfectly describes 2020 for me too. There is an element of trust that things will work out, care in setting your foot, wisdom in making the choices, confidence that you will find the way and physical capacities that you will need when the river pulls you off the slippery stones. \"You have the best long form videos about female nature online.

A geomagnetic storm occurred in 1859, producing an aurora that could be seen everywhere in Hawaii. It had an impact on the telegraph system; however, some operating systems were said to be able to convey messages even when their batteries weren't plugged in. They were surprisingly only making use of the geomagnetic storm's current. The size of this geomagnetic storm was unprecedented in recorded history. A super solar strike doesn't happen infrequently, and it may occur today and be far worse. It might take more from the world to recover from a solar strike of this magnitude than the top ten natural disasters in the US put together.

{"sentence": "Scientists Discovered NEW Planet Better Than  Earth! Finally astronomers are finding more of the billions of super-Earths they believe to be out there. Super-Earths are larger, more common, and more habitable than Earth itself. Astronomers are able to learn more about how Earth's rocky relatives appear around other stars as they increase the known population of far-off planets, or exoplanets. And they frequently stumble across oddballs in their studies, such as a recently discovered planet bathed in molten magma whose \"year\" only lasts a half-day.

So the Lord said to Solomon, \u201cBecause you have done this, and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely ear the kingdom from you, and will give it to your servant.\u201d 1 Kings 3 10-12 10 The Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked for this. 11 So God said to him, \u201cSince you have asked for this and not for long life or wealth for yourself, nor have asked for the death of your enemies but for discernment in administering justice, 12 I will do what you have asked. I will give you a wise and discerning heart, so that there will never have been anyone like you, nor will there ever be.

Men need to man up and give women the equality they fought so hard to achieve so that these women can then woman up and deal with everything like a man. Because once women get a taste of TRUE equality with equal rights and equal punishment they will hate it so much that they will beg for traditionalism to return. It is time to use gender equality to destroy gender equality. Because after all equality is fair, but that doesn\u2019t always mean equality is going to be fun.\" unquote. Well Luke thanks for the donation and topic. Women don't want equality they want equity. What you're proposing equality for them they got fifteen to twenty years ago and they were still crying that the traditional patriarchy was oppressing them. They want to have their cake and eat it too. They want equal outcomes even when they put out unequal effort. Plus equality is a weasel word. Most women have no idea what it really means. The reason women will never beg for traditionalism is because women have equality right now and most are loving it. Social media provides them way more attention then the old 1950s living arrangement of a husband and kids. Working is more fulfilling for them because they went stir crazy staying at home as housewives in the 1950s and 1960s. Remember they went to work outside the home as slaves to a corporation so they could set themselves free. Most still prefer that and are fine going off to work the way that men do. It was their new purpose once life got longer and they stopped being perpetually pregnant. Women will never beg for traditionalism. They would rather die and get eaten by cats with their digested remains being scooped up from the kitty litter. They will mulch up real nice. I don't want to got back to the future either when it comes to a future that resembles the 1950s. Feminism set us men free from having to be a plowshare so we could plow some pretty woman. At some point one of three things will happen. Number one we will use technology to reproduce like Brave New World. Number two populations will continue crashing until our civilization decomplexifies and we have to start living as subsistence farmers again. If that happens then we have traditionalism again because you need kids to help you work the land. Or number three there is a big war that wipes out most of industrial civilization and then we once again go back to traditionalism. Luke I would be cheering for the world with technological reproduction. That's the real equality we need to see. Then men would work and put their surplus resources into reproduction and women would continues putting their surplus into cats and the male population would be fine using cloning or artificial wombs.

What you think? Would MGTOW do this kind of study? I would like to know your opinion. Thank you. I am a purple man married and with children, Dominican and I live in Spain. I think I'm with a NAWALT, but deep down I think I'll end MGTOW. Excuse my bad English, feel free to correct what you consider. I have never studied English, but I have an acceptable written and oral understanding. Stay firm, and good work.\" Well Dario thanks for the donation and topic. The Venus project and or Zeitgeist movement is a cult based around socialism. It doesn't understand the fundamentals of human nature and motivation. Once upon a time back in 2010 or 2011 I went to a few events put on by the Zeitgeist movement and one of them was with the film-makers for a film called living without money. The room was packed with tons of young, dumb and full of come idealistic men and women that had no idea what it's like in the real world. After watching the documentary about a European woman named: Heidemarie Schwermer that sold all of her belongings and then travelled around Europe and parts of the world trying to live for a few years without money you could really see they were clueless. She wasn't living without money, she was living by taking advantage of other people's money by dumpster diving, couch surfing, bumming money for train rides and other forms of begging. What people in the Zeitgeist movement don't understand is that human nature for the most part means that the majority of humans will take from others given the chance to do so just like the woman that was supposedly living without money. Here's a quote from the Zeitgeist movement website so you know exactly what I'm talking about: \"In a Resource Based Economy all goods and services are available to all people without the need for means of exchange such as money, credits, barter or any other means. For this to be achieved all resources must be declared as the common heritage of all Earth\u2019s inhabitants. Equipped with the latest scientific and technological marvels mankind could reach extremely high productivity levels and create abundance of resources.\" unquote. Yes this would work in a group of individuals that were workaholics with an insane work ethic while another part of soceity consumed their labor. The majority of people out there are lazy and will try to live off the fat of the land or suckle at the teets of productive people.

Spend a sheet-ton of money buying handjob stuff at handjob boutiques. Then work like a dog to pay for all these \"natural alternatives\". What if there were a better way? A way that guys could create simple rules that make decision making easy. That lesson the need to \"trust\" companies to put what they say is on the list of ingredients or organic or whatever.

{"sentence": "New Discovery On Jupiters Moon Has Scientists Shocked! New Discovery On Jupiters Moon Has Scientists Shocked! Unlike Earth, the planet Jupiter has more than one moon. In fact, Jupiter has at least 79 different moons, and Europa is just one of them. Europa is the sixth-largest moon in the Jovian system, and is about 90 percent the size of our own moon that orbits Earth. Recently, the Hubble Space Telescope made a discovery that shocked and excited NASA. After years of suspicion and speculation, Hubble detected water vapor in the atmosphere of Europa. This massive discovery gives scientists a much better understanding of Jupiter\u2019s moons and offers the idea that maybe - just maybe - Europa has conditions that are hospitable for life. If that were the case, it means that future scientific missions related to the Jovian system will have a strong focus on finding life.

A woman may want to go out with you today and not tomorrow and you have to expect it. You cant be walking around with that air of certainty. The thing is us guys, we\u2019re wired to take any type of attention from women as though there\u2019s potential to sex. 2. A lot of times women will test you to see how strong you are as a person. She\u2019ll make fun of you, she\u2019ll troll you just to see if you\u2019re willing to stand up to her. 3. Generally it takes time for a woman to like you in a social setting. As long as you\u2019re respectful, as long as you do your work, somebody\u2019s gonna end up liking you. They may not like you at first but over time, they\u2019ll start to see your personality and sometimes women are endeared by it and they end up liking you.

{"sentence": "5 minutes ago We report extremely sad news about 77-year-old legend Tom Selleck, goodbye Selleck. 5 minutes ago We report extremely sad news about 77-year-old legend Tom Selleck, goodbye Selleck. #tomselleck Selleck was born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1945, to housewife Martha Selleck (n\u00e9e Jagger)[2] and Robert Dean Selleck, who was an executive and real estate investor.[3][4][5] He has an elder brother Robert (born 1944), a younger sister Martha (born 1954), and a younger brother Daniel (born 1956).[6] His father was of primarily English ancestry but had distant German ancestry as well, while his mother was of English descent. Through an entirely paternal line, Selleck is a direct descendant of English colonist David Selleck who moved to Massachusetts from Somerset, England, in 1633. Through this line, Selleck is of the 11th generation of his family born in North America.[7][8] Selleck's family moved to Sherman Oaks, California, in 1948. Selleck graduated from Grant High School in 1962[10] and enrolled at Los Angeles Valley College, living at home and saving money.[11] Selleck, who stands 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) tall, transferred to the University of Southern California during his junior year to play for the USC Trojans men's basketball team.[12] He also was a pitcher for the USC baseball team.[13] He is a member of Sigma Chi fraternity and a member of the Trojan Knights. While Selleck was majoring in Business Administration, a drama coach suggested he try acting and, in his senior year, he dropped out of the university.[14] Selleck then studied acting at the Beverly Hills Playhouse, under Milton Katselas. Selleck's first television appearance was as a college senior on The Dating Game in 1965 and again in 1967. Soon after, he appeared in commercials for products such as Pepsi-Cola. He began his career with bit parts in smaller movies, including Myra Breckinridge (invited on the set by Mae West),[17] Coma, and The Seven Minutes. He appeared in a number of TV series, mini-series and TV movies. He was also the face of Salem cigarettes and Revlon's Chaz cologne.[17] Selleck appeared in the commercial for Right Guard deodorant in 1971, with Farrah Fawcett in 1972 for the aperitif Dubonnet, and another in 1977 for the toothpaste Close-Up. He was also in a Safeguard deodorant soap commercial (1972). In 1972, he starred in the B-movie Daughters of Satan. He had a recurring role in the 1970s as private investigator Lance White in The Rockford Files. Selleck is an avid outdoorsman, marksman and firearms collector. These interests led him to leading-man cowboy roles in Western films, starting with his role as cowboy and frontier marshal Orrin Sackett in the 1979 film The Sacketts, opposite Sam Elliott, Jeff Osterhage, and Western legends Glenn Ford and Ben Johnson, and that same year, Concrete Cowboys with Jerry Reed. The Shadow Riders followed in 1982. Then Selleck shifted gears, portraying a cat burglar in 1930s London in Lassiter in 1984. Quigley Down Under is one of his best-known Western films, but it was for his 1997 role in Last Stand at Saber River that he won a \"Western Heritage Award\". Selleck's big break came when he was cast in the lead role as Thomas Magnum in Magnum, P.I. The producers would not release the actor for other projects, so Selleck had to pass on the role of Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark, which meant that the role went to actor Harrison Ford instead. It turned out that the shooting of the pilot for Magnum was delayed for over six months by a writers' strike, which would have enabled him to complete Raiders. Selleck played the role of Thomas Magnum in 1980 after filming six other TV pilots that were never sold. Magnum was a former U.S. Navy Officer, a veteran of a Special Operations unit, \"SEAL\" in the Vietnam War, and later a member of the \"Naval Intelligence Agency\" (a fictional version of the Office of Naval Intelligence), who had resigned his commission with the Navy to become a private investigator living in Hawaii. The show continued until 1988, lasting eight seasons and 163 episodes, winning him an Emmy Award[20] for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1984. Selleck was famous for his mustache, a Hawaiian-style aloha shirt, a Detroit Tigers baseball cap, and a Colt MKIV/Series 70 Government Model handgun (a commercial version of the U.S. Military M1911A1) which his character regularly carried. The actual prop from the show was a 9\u00d719mm Parabellum, serial number 70L33101, used for its reliable functioning with readily available blanks, although the original gun was a traditional .45 ACP 1911. Magnum also used a Star Model B, another 9mm similar to the M1911A1, and a Detonics Pocket 9 during the series. Magnum drove a Ferrari 308 GTS in the series. The model became so identified with the role that Ferrari fans now refer to the red-painted model as a \"Magnum\" Ferrari. After the end of the show in 1988, it established itself as the top-rated one-hour show in the history of syndicated reruns (at least until 1998).", "label": "harmful"}

Some will want to be blind in order to stay in something that will help mask pain or anesthetize something of the past or a fear of the future. It\u2019s a pretty cursory assessment, but I would say that chaos is largely centered around these two types of paths. The one that is out of control and the one that is in our control and that we perpetuate by small decisions over and over again, often over many years, decades. Also, this can connect to one\u2019s diet. Let\u2019s face it, for many people that end up having heart attacks, it\u2019s a willful entrance into the heart attack because the taste of the food is so good or that you have to have the food around to keep a wound away and to help anesthetize it. Many people treat relationships the same way. They keep a relationship going not because they want to build but because they want to mask. The interesting thing here is that, this often creates the most opportunity for red pill wisdom to be accrued, because some of the greatest insight from men regarding MGTOW and the red pill is wisdom that has been accrued during these periods of willful blindness in relationships, and honestly, in life in general - in health, in habits, in patterns, in ways of living, in practices. The dichotomy at play here is that, this assumes that, even when you go MGTOW, you\u2019re going to have to put out small fires along the way. When you are in a relationship that you shouldn\u2019t be in and you are willfully blind, what is happening is that you are letting the fires just continue to burn. The house that you have built, this false facade of a relationship, is going to stand for a few years, a decade, maybe longer, but in your heart of hearts, you know that this house is going to burn down eventually. There is no way that it is going to be able to endure the raging flames that are coming its way. #hoodiesup", "label": "harmful"}

But fifty years after the Apollo 11 landing, Earth's only natural satellite is still a very foreign place to us, and its geology and history are still mysterious\u2014in large part because we haven't been there since 1972.

{"sentence": "Importing Foreign Brides - MGTOW \"Hello Sandman, I have been single for many years, perhaps unconsciously knowing I\u2019m better off going it alone. Your analyses confirm how I feel given my few sad experiences with, what I eventually discovered to be, abusive women. No, I am not playing the victim card; I am living and learning. I\u2019ve realized that falling in love with a woman you like blinds you to the subtle manipulations, or verbal abuse, until the shrill shatters the glass bell jar and you regain consciousness after the blow. I can now see the red flags before they\u2019re even raised and have managed to keep myself out of trouble for a good long while. But other times it seems like a disadvantage in not allowing myself to be vulnerable. I must admit that for many years I respected women because of the respect I felt for my mother as an amazingly unique, humble, wise and kind woman. With my sister, however, I had a friendly yet distant relationship. In this light I accepted feminism until only just recently, once it became clear to me the new wave is really about gaining additional legal powers without balancing responsibilities, and what I see repeatedly happening in the courtroom. Amazingly, some of these facts I\u2019ve weaned from women themselves, such as Diana Davidson, Janice Fiamengo, ChristyoMisty, Karen Straughan, Helen Smith; women who have impressed me as our best defenders. When my mother died a few years ago, I understood the nature of my relationship with my sister. She became highly deceitful and manipulative as she deliberately concealed my mother\u2019s will from me, wherein I later discovered she had named me as her executor for a small property she left behind but my sister decided to keep for herself. But never mind this family dynamic. I think what I am trying to get at is that despite all I know now and years of undefined self exile or MGTOW, I still feel a longing for caring female companionship. The easy question is, how do I get over it, exactly? Yes, I have my job and my hobbies, but still, is this romanticized notion absolutely always just smoke and mirrors? You once talked briefly about Eastern European women and how they take better care of themselves, and how they have to work harder for a limited supply of Alpha males, or Beta, or whatever. I had an opportunity to see this first hand while volunteering at an English School in Ukraine. The population of females there appears to be skewed in favor of men. Yet many women appear to have trouble with and reject their own society men because of alcohol addiction, gender abuse, or the serious lack of opportunities for men to excel within their post-Russian society. 10 pictures paid for and licensed through BigStock.com (In order of appearance) 1.

{"sentence": "Mangs' 4th \"Impossible Challenge\" destroyed by (not) Grimm Guy and his friend. (Risky Vale - Day 20) Let's see how Grimm Guy's new friend will beat a new \"impossible challenge\" from Mangs. So, Jess vs Sturm and Kanbei, on Risky Vale again, but AW2 style. This one wasn't too hard to beat because of how awful the AI in this game is (plus, playing and finding low turn strats in Mangsvance Wars for now a year helped). RNG is almost a non-issue, outside maybe to get the 3rd Sturm's base. Other than that, it's pretty straightforward and, unless I missed something (though I didn't really test the RNG that much), I don't see this going too low for a perfect run. I know a few points at the end where I could have easily cut a day or two but the point was to complete it since there is way too much AI shenanigans to deal with in that many turns for me to post this quick enough. I'm looking forward to see that run happen though, I'm curious if my strat was close or not to what should be done for the run to be perfect.

The theory that humans originated from a single group of people who lived in Africa hundreds of thousands of years ago has been disproved by a recent study that combines archaeology, anthropology, and genealogy. How come we used to be so much more similar? How did we mistakenly come to believe that all humans descended from a primitive group in East Africa? Let\u2019s find out! We had far wilder and more colorful beginnings. The protracted process of change that separated humans from their apelike forebears is known as human evolution. According to scientific research, the physical characteristics and behavioral features that all humans share have their roots in apelike ancestors and have been evolving for almost six million years.

There are people that may have had a change of email or bank accounts please reach out to me via email so that we can find a solution, I am willing to work with you and we will get to the bottom of it.

{"sentence": "Gender Neutral Bathrooms - MGTOW I want to talk about new trend where Canadian high schools and universities are creating gender neutral bathrooms and by default going to eventually ban male urinals. The first link in the description is from one of my earlier videos talking about how European countries, most notably Sweden have been trying to ban male urinals. But I honestly think the real push to get rid of them will be using first the excuse of trans gendered children wanting their own single use gender neutral bathrooms and then schools will eventually take things even further. Gender neutral bathrooms have been put into many public schools in cities like Ottawa, Vancouver, an Edmonton Catholic high school as well as Toronto. But now they are taking things to the next level. They are creating larger all-gender washrooms in Toronto. The second link in the description below is to an article called: \"No More Women\u2019s Rooms: Why Bathrooms Should All Be Gender-Neutral.\" Here's a quote as to why they are a bad idea, or good idea based on your perspective. \"women with histories of sexual assault or rape will be made uncomfortable by the presence of men in the bathroom, especially if there\u2019s any possibility of seeing a penis at the urinals; men will not feel comfortable using the urinals with women in the room or having to urinate sitting down in the absence of urinals. People often have a visceral oh hell no reaction to the concept of allowing people of any gender to use any public restroom. But from a queer perspective, most of these arguments are questionable.\" The foremost reason for being anti-bathroom-neutralization involves the sensitive issue of sexual assault. Many people who believe gender-neutral bathrooms would benefit society in both providing for the needs of trans* people and helping to alleviate severe separations between the genders don\u2019t want to be insensitive to the needs of sexual assault survivors. So there you have it folks the real reason this is an issue up for debate is because no one wants to offend either the women that may or may not have been sexually assaulted or the trans people that want to be included in the community. But what about men. Yes it's mentioned that men will feel uncomfortable if women check out their weenies at the stall. So I predict that to quote unquote satisfy men from being stared at by women the urinals will be removed for men's benefit as well as the so called benefit of women that were victims of assault. Because god knows if a woman sees a flaccid penis she could have a Vietnam style flashback in the middle of the washroom.

Zack is a barista who doesn't make big tips, and Miri isn't exactly making top dollar either. Friends since grade school, they share a cramped apartment together, but the bills are piling up faster than their paychecks. Then, at their class reunion, the two friends meet up with a former classmate who's shot to success in the adult film industry. Inspired after a YouTube video of Miri in her granny panties goes viral, Zack and his roommate round up a crew and begin production on their masterpiece. When the time comes for Zack and Miri to shoot their first scene together, however, unexpected emotions start to bubble to the surface, prompting them both to wonder if they've somehow mistaken true love for mere friendship all these years.

{"sentence": "China OFFICIALLY Reveals Plan To Colonize Mars by 2033 China OFFICIALLY Reveals Plan To Colonize Mars by 2033. The race to Mars continues! In a major move intending to set itself ahead of all competition, including Russia and the United States, China just announced that it is planning to send its first crewed mission to Mars by the year 2033. Not only that, but the country also wants to build a permanent station on that red planet and has four more missions scheduled there after its first trip in 2033. Just like that, China has made a huge statement and has ratcheted up the stakes of the modern space race. You can bet every other country on Earth is jealous and scratching their heads about how they can surpass China and beat them to Mars. Even SpaceX has announced plans to visit the red planet but they are known for having small setbacks that could delay their own mission by a few years. China's latest announcement will surely give fuel to the fire for not only the US but other countries as well. The head of the state-owned China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology laid out the grand plans this week at a space conference in Russia. The bombshell announcement comes just weeks after China landed its very own rover on Mars. That feat made them the second country to have a presence on Mars, right behind the United States which has sent a slew of remote-controlled robots to the Martian service.

{"sentence": "Something TERRIBLE Is Happening To Africa & No One Knows Why The Earth is a globe where change is constant, even if we may not always be able to detect it. One such theory is plate tectonics. However, every now and again, something spectacular occurs, raising fresh concerns about the continent of Africa splitting in two. Recent events in south-western Kenya have resulted in the rapid development of a massive fracture, measuring several miles in length. Part of the Nairobi-Narok roadway collapsed due to the growing rip. Africa, the second-largest continent, is slowly being torn apart by a massive gap. When the region's tectonic plates, the planet's outer sections, collide, mountains form, and when they pull apart, enormous basins form.

It's a battle of the billionaires and their epic dreams of racing into the cosmos. SpaceX's Elon Musk versus Amazon's Jeff Bezos. Which one will win? Who will touch the furthest reaches of the stars first? Who is creating the interstellar vehicle that is most capable and impressive? These two heavyweights of industry are throwing around a lot of money to get their space-venturing companies literally off the ground. But when it comes right down to it, It all depends on the sort of ships they are creating, right? Without those, space travel is completely impossible. So today we are going to take a look at the most prized possessions of Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin. In one corner, we have SpaceX's Starship, a vessel so powerful and so impressive that even NASA is looking to get its hands on it. And in the other corner is Blue Origin's New Glenn, a reusable rocket that has some really impressive features but is having just a little bit of trouble getting up and running.

The writer-director, Hadas Ben Aroya, seems interested in how hedonistic lifestyles can lubricate certain forms of intimacy while hindering others, and she conveys this paradox through a series of patient long takes. The first chapter trails Danny (Hadar Katz) as she wanders around a house party in search of Max (Leib Lev Levin). She finds him seated beside the enigmatic Avishag (Elisheva Weil), Max\u2019s new girlfriend and the chief subject of the film\u2019s next two parts: in one, Avishag explores rough erotics with Max; and in the final, she initiates a flirtation with a staid older man. \u05d6\u05d5\u05db\u05d4 \u05e4\u05e8\u05e1 \u05d4\u05e9\u05d7\u05e7\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea \u05d5\u05d4\u05e1\u05e8\u05d8 \u05d4\u05d8\u05d5\u05d1 \u05d1\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea\u05e8 \u2013 \u05e4\u05e1\u05d8\u05d9\u05d1\u05dc \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd \u05e4\u05e1\u05d8\u05d9\u05d1\u05dc \u05d1\u05e8\u05dc\u05d9\u05df 2021 \u05d3\u05e0\u05d9 \u05de\u05d7\u05e4\u05e9\u05ea \u05d0\u05ea \u05de\u05e7\u05e1 \u05d1\u05de\u05e1\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4 \u05db\u05d3\u05d9 \u05dc\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d5 \u05e9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d0 \u05d1\u05d4\u05e8\u05d9\u05d5\u05df \u05de\u05de\u05e0\u05d5, \u05d5\u05de\u05d2\u05dc\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05d1\u05d6\u05d5\u05d2\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d7\u05d3\u05e9\u05d4 \u05e2\u05dd \u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05e9\u05d2. \u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05e9\u05d2 \u05d5\u05de\u05e7\u05e1 \u05de\u05e0\u05e1\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d4\u05d2\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd \u05e4\u05e0\u05d8\u05d6\u05d9\u05d4 \u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea \u05e9\u05dc \u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05e9\u05d2, \u05d0\u05d1\u05dc \u05d4\u05e0\u05d9\u05e1\u05d9\u05d5\u05df \u05d9\u05d5\u05e6\u05d0 \u05de\u05db\u05dc\u05dc \u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05d8\u05d4. \u05d3\u05e8\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d4\u05de\u05d1\u05d5\u05d2\u05e8 \u05e0\u05d1\u05d4\u05dc \u05dc\u05d2\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05d3\u05d5\u05d2\u05d5\u05d5\u05e7\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5, \u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05e9\u05d2, \u05d9\u05e9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d5 \u05d1\u05de\u05d9\u05d8\u05d4, \u05d0\u05da \u05d1\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd \u05de\u05ea\u05e4\u05ea\u05d7\u05ea \u05e7\u05e8\u05d1\u05d4 \u05de\u05e4\u05ea\u05d9\u05e2\u05d4. \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05e9\u05d4 \u05e4\u05e8\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05de\u05e6\u05d9\u05d2\u05d9\u05dd \u05e6\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d8\u05d5\u05d7\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05e2\u05e6\u05de\u05dd \u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05db\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05e0\u05e1\u05d5\u05ea \u05db\u05dc \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d0\u05d1\u05dc \u05dc\u05d0 \u05de\u05e1\u05d5\u05d2\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d7\u05d6\u05d5\u05ea \u05db\u05d9\u05e6\u05d3 \u05d4\u05d7\u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05dc\u05dc\u05d5 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e4\u05d9\u05e2\u05d5 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4\u05dd. \"\u05de\u05d9\u05e9\u05d4\u05d5 \u05d9\u05d0\u05d4\u05d1 \u05de\u05d9\u05e9\u05d4\u05d5\" \u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05de\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 \u05e4\u05e0\u05d5\u05e8\u05de\u05d9\u05ea \u05e9\u05dc \u05d3\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e9\u05e9\u05d5\u05d0\u05dc: \u05db\u05de\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d9\u05d1\u05e8\u05dc\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05e0\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05d0\u05de\u05ea?. \u05d1\u05e1\u05e8\u05d8\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d3\u05e1 \u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d5\u05d9\u05d4 (\"\u05d0\u05e0\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05d4\u05dd \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d0\u05e0\u05d9\") \u05de\u05e6\u05dc\u05d9\u05d7\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d4\u05d1\u05d9\u05d0 \u05e9\u05d5\u05d1 \u05d1\u05de\u05d1\u05e2 \u05e7\u05d5\u05dc\u05e0\u05d5\u05e2\u05d9 \u05d9\u05d9\u05d7\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9 \u05d5\u05de\u05d3\u05d5\u05d9\u05d9\u05e7 \u05d0\u05ea \u05e1\u05d9\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d3\u05d5\u05e8, \u05d1\u05d9\u05e6\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4 \u05e1\u05d5\u05d7\u05e4\u05ea, \u05d0\u05de\u05d9\u05e6\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d9\u05d5\u05e6\u05d0\u05ea \u05d3\u05d5\u05e4\u05df. \u05d4\u05e1\u05e8\u05d8 \u05d4\u05d5\u05e7\u05e8\u05df \u05dc\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e4\u05e1\u05d8\u05d9\u05d1\u05dc \u05d1\u05e8\u05dc\u05d9\u05df \u05d5\u05d6\u05db\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e4\u05e8\u05e1 \u05d4\u05e9\u05d7\u05e7\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea \u05d5\u05d1\u05e4\u05e8\u05e1 \u05d4\u05e1\u05e8\u05d8 \u05d4\u05d8\u05d5\u05d1 \u05d1\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea\u05e8 \u05d1\u05e4\u05e1\u05d8\u05d9\u05d1\u05dc \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd.", "label": "harmful"}

{"sentence": "Why is Sandman Here? - MGTOW \"Hope you're well, Sandman. To inspire men to think for themselves and hold women's lives in contempt in the same disposable way that women hold men's lives in contempt is a shared goal. Women see men as disposable \u2013 and that's exactly how men should see women's lives. Many people (both men and women) dislike the idea of Men Going Their Own Way. Why? Because we live in a gynocentric society. A woman first society. Feminism is nothing more than hypergynocentrism and men that dislike MGTOW generally do so because they have daughters that might suffer from men opting out, haven't yet been divorce raped, or are seriously naive or they are beta male servants of the gynocracy. And beta male servants of the gynocracy very often mistakenly see themselves as alpha males. They \"white knight\" and/or \"damsel\" the gynocracy to curry favor. Additionally, marriage and divorce are multi-billion dollar a year businesses - so there are many that have their livelihoods and hopes for financial security tied to marriage and/or divorce \u2013 especially women. The #1 way in which men's lives are destroyed is through marriage, divorce and/or false accusations. MGTOW's primary advice to men is to never get married or otherwise give a woman any significant power over their lives; thereby limiting women's and in-law's destructive power. The vast majority of men's problems evaporate simply by limiting women's social, physical, emotional, psychological, legal and financial power over their lives. It's easy to see why many people see MGTOW as a threat to their security and financial goals. The goal of those opposed to MGTOW is to discredit MGTOW and paint the MGTOW mindset in a negative light in order to keep men on the plantation. This is typically accomplished through all forms of shaming and may even result in social and financial ostracization through job loss and/or false accusations. Several great books that cover the primary ideals of the MGTOW mindset but are not books specifically on MGTOW. The Myth of Male Power, Stand by Your Manhood, (Women First, Men Last) and The Manipulated Man come to mind. Anyway, my question to you Sandman is this: Why do you invest so much of yourself into the MGTOW community?

Six galaxies in the early universe have been found by researchers, and they are so incredibly enormous that they question our fundamental conception of the world.

The primordial galaxies were formed about 500\u2013700 million years after the Big Bang, but they are almost as massive as the present Milky Way in terms of mass, with masses that are close to 100 billion times that of the Sun.

They are not verbally or physically abusive towards anyone. It's important to have a rigid schedule and focus on personal growth rather than chasing after women. This is what sets apart high value men from the rest. Also note that, if a woman is not interested in you, it's better to move on rather than trying to force a relationship.

But renowned American physicist Michio Kaku has just revealed that the science community has had it all wrong. In a revolutionary discovery brought to light by the legendary James Webb Space Telescope, it turns out that time as we know it doesn't exist at all.

Five years later, a new group of co-eds converges near Camp Crystal Lake, scene of the original massacre and the drowning of Jason Vorhees that preceded it. This time around, the horny collegians attend a nearby training school for camp counselors. As half the group parties in town, an unseen assailant picks off the other half one by one. Only when camp leader Paul (John Furey) and his girlfriend, Ginny (Amy Steel), return to camp do they uncover the identity of their stalker -- none other than Jason (Warrington Gillette) himself, alive but grotesquely deformed as a result of his childhood drowning. Flashbacks chronicle Jason's behind-the-scenes activities in the first film (perhaps explaining how his mother was able to throw the dead bodies of muscular youths through windows with such apparent ease). The young couple's only hope to defeat the fiend lies in psych major Ginny's insights in Jason's mental state.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \u00a9 Paramount (1981)\nCast: Marta Kober, Bill Randolph\nDirector: Steve Miner\nProducers: Lisa Barsamian, Tom Gruenberg, Frank Mancuso Jr., Steve Miner, Dennis Stuart Murphy\nScreenwriters: Ron Kurz, Victor Miller\n\nWHO ARE WE?\nThe MOVIECLIPS channel is the largest collection of licensed movie clips on the web.

{"sentence": "Predatory Females - MGTOW Predatory Females - MGTOW MGTOW Mystery Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUtlXqY4iKY Hi Everyone Sandman Here, This video is brought to you by a donation from Marvin and here's what he has to say: \"Hello Sandman, One of the worst horror stories I know of, showing just what female nature is capable of, and how cruel woman can be, involved a relation of mine who was in one of the services. His wife monkey branched to his best friend just before he was about to retire. She then filed for divorce and expelled him from his home and attempted to cut him off from all contact with his children. To make matters even worse, his mother-in-law attempted to replace him as the \"father\" of his young children. He got all this news right before Christmas of last year, just in time for the holidays. The torrent of mental abuse he received from his wife and mother-in-law pushed him over the edge and, through a series of unfortunate events, let to him being shot by the police after a failed suicide attempt. He survived. However, as the holiday season draws near, I fear for him and his mental stability. He is a good guy, and never deserved any of this. The large-scale victimization of men by women is very real. I have experienced it personally, and I have seen it happen to many other men. Thank you, Sandman, for educating men about female nature: the single greatest threat to their happiness and well-being that they are ever likely to face during their lives. By the way, Sandman, I have a question and a request for you. I have several young nephews in their early 20s who are kind, intelligent, financially successful, and attractive. This makes them the perfect prey for predatory females. I want to warn them about female nature, but don't know how to approach this topic with them. How would you do it? Could you consider making a video containing this advice? Many thanks.?\" Although I think you may have just answered my request with your video for teenage boys! This Xmas, I am going to refer my young nephews to your channel and I truly hope they will listen to what you have to say, because it could literally save them from a lifetime of regrets and losses. Perhaps after what happened last Xmas, they will listen. What a nightmare. As for myself, if I could have heard and acted on the knowledge contained in your educational videos when I was young, I could have avoided the vast majority of pain, suffering, and financial losses that I have incurred during my life. You are really making a difference!\" Well Marvin thanks for the donation and topic. I'm glad I've already answered the part of your question where you want to know how to talk to your nephews about female nature and being taken advantage of the predatory female. I can generalise female nature by saying that famous line from the film Fight Club where Tyler Durden says that she's a predator posing as a house pet. A good predator will use camoflouge and stealth so that you don't see them coming. The female chameleon hides by wrapping herself in the same interests as you. 10 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com. All image licenses are available upon request.", "label": "harmful"}

From the Chinese National Space Program to private companies, SpaceX's design of reusable rockets is gaining ground fast in the Asian country.

He has been nominated for Olivier, Tony, Golden Globe, Emmy, and Screen Actors Guild Awards. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 16 December 1996. In 2010, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for services to drama. In 1966, Stewart became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Stewart made his Broadway theatre debut in 1971 in a production of A Midsummer Night's Dream. In 1979, he received the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance in Antony and Cleopatra in the West End. His first television role was in the ITV series Coronation Street in 1967. His first major screen roles were in BBC-broadcast television productions Fall of Eagles (1974), I, Claudius (1976), and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (1979). In 2008 he played King Claudius in Hamlet and received his second Olivier Award and his first Tony Award nomination for respective the West End and Broadway theatre productions. Stewart gained stardom for his leading role as Captain Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987\u201394), its subsequent films, and Star Trek: Picard (2020\u2013present). He starred as Captain Ahab in the USA Network series Moby Dick (1998), Ebenezer Scrooge in TNT's A Christmas Carol (1999), and King Henry II in Showtime's The Lion in Winter (2003). He also became known for his comedic appearances on the NBC sitcom Frasier and the BBC series Extras for which he received Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series nomination. He recently starred as the lead of the Starz series Blunt Talk (2015\u20132016). He currently voices CIA Deputy Director Avery Bullock on American Dad!. Stewart's first film role was in Trevor Nunn's Hedda (1975) followed performances in John Boorman's Excalibur (1981), and David Lynch's Dune (1984). He gained further stardom when portrayed Professor Charles Xavier in the X-Men series (2000\u20132009), Logan (2017), and an alternate version of the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022). He's appeared in films such as L.A. Story (1991), Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993), Jeffrey (1995), and The Kid Who Would Be King (2019). He is also known for his voice work in films such as The Pagemaster (1994), The Prince of Egypt (1998), Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius (2001), Chicken Little (2005), Gnomeo & Juliet (2011), and Ted (2012). Stewart was born on 13 July 1940 in Mirfield,[1] in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England, to Gladys (n\u00e9e Barrowclough), a weaver and textile worker, and Alfred Stewart (1905\u20131980). He has two older brothers, Geoffrey (b. 1933) and Trevor (b. 1935).[2][3][4] His parents did not give him a middle name, but he used the middle name \"Hewes\" professionally for a while in the 1980s.[5] Stewart spent much of his childhood in Jarrow. He grew up in a poor household and suffered from domestic violence inflicted by his father, an experience which later influenced his political and ideological beliefs.[6] Alfred Stewart had been a regimental sergeant major in the British Army during the Second World War, and worked as a general labourer and as a postman.[7] As a result of his wartime experience during the Dunkirk evacuation, Stewart's father suffered from what was then known as combat fatigue (related to what is now known as post-traumatic stress disorder). In a 2008 interview, Stewart said: My father was a very potent individual, a very powerful man, who got what he wanted. It was said that when he strode onto the parade ground, birds stopped singing. It was many, many years before I realised how my father inserted himself into my work. I've grown a moustache for Macbeth. My father didn't have one, but when I looked in the mirror just before I went on stage I saw my father's face staring straight back at me.[8] Stewart attended Crowlees Church of England Junior and Infants School.[9] He attributes his acting career to his English teacher, Cecil Dormand, who \"put a copy of Shakespeare in my hand [and] said, 'Now get up on your feet and perform'.\"[10] In 1951, aged 11, Stewart entered Mirfield Secondary Modern School,[11][12] where he continued to study drama. Around the same time he met the actor Brian Blessed at a Mytholmroyd drama course, and the two have been friends ever since.[1", "label": "harmful"}

The sad life and tragic end of actor Kelsey Grammer. #kelseygrammer Allen Kelsey Grammer (born February 21, 1955) is an American actor, comedian and producer. For two decades, Grammer played psychiatrist Dr. Frasier Crane on the NBC sitcom Cheers and its spin-off Frasier, winning four Primetime Emmy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards for the role. His other roles include the political drama series Boss for which he won a Golden Globe Award, the period drama series The Last Tycoon, and a recurring guest role as the voice of Sideshow Bob in The Simpsons, with additional voice roles in Anastasia (1997) and Toy Story 2 (1999). He has also appeared in various television shows such as 30 Rock, Modern Family, and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Grammer is also known for his work in theatre, acting alongside Christopher Plummer and James Earl Jones in Othello, and Macbeth on Broadway.[3] In 1983, he starred alongside Mandy Patinkin in Stephen Sondheim's Sunday in the Park with George at Playwrights Horizons, Off-Broadway. He has also starred in productions of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street playing the title character, and My Fair Lady as Professor Henry Higgins. In 2010, he received his first Tony Award nomination for his performance in La Cage aux Folles.[4] In 2016, Grammer won a Tony Award as a producer of The Color Purple. In 2019, he starred as Don Quixote in a production of Man of La Mancha at the London Coliseum. In the course of his career in television Grammer has won five Primetime Emmy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, one Daytime Emmy Award and one Tony Award. Additionally, he has also worked as a television producer, director, and writer. Allen Kelsey Grammer was born on February 21, 1955, in Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands,[2][1] the son of Sally (n\u00e9e Cranmer; 1928\u20132008),[5][6] a singer and actress, and Frank Allen Grammer Jr. (d. 1968),[5] a musician and owner of a coffee shop and a bar and grill called Greer's Place.[7][8] He had one younger sister, Karen, and four half-siblings from his father's second marriage. Grammer's personal life has been surrounded by family tragedies. He was raised by his mother and maternal grandparents, Gordon and Evangeline Cranmer, in New Jersey.[9] The family later moved to Pompano Beach, Florida, and shortly afterwards, when Kelsey was twelve years old, his grandfather died of cancer.[9] In 1968, his father was murdered by an \u201canti-white\u201d cab driver during a wave of racial violence following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.[10][11][12] In 1975, his sister was kidnapped, raped, and murdered in Colorado Springs.[13] In 1980, his two teenage half-brothers died in a scuba diving accident.[14] Grammer attended Pine Crest School, a private preparatory school in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.[9] It was there that he first began to sing and perform on stage.[9] Grammer won a scholarship to study drama at the Juilliard School.[9] He was a member of Group 6 from 1973 to 1975.[15] Owing to his sister's murder, however, Grammer failed to attend classes and was eventually expelled.[9] According to his interview with the Cayman Compass in 2019, Grammer described himself as \"a Caribbean kid\" who \"was born in St. Thomas, USVI, and I have been back and forth a lot, gone to the Bahamas a lot, St. John and the Virgin Islands and the BVI.\" Grammer has been married four times and has seven children and one grandchild as of 2011.[34] His first marriage, to dance instructor Doreen Alderman,[35] lasted from 1982 to 1990, although they were separated for the last six years of that period.[36] They have one daughter, actress Spencer Grammer (born October 9, 1983).[37] Through Spencer, Grammer has one grandson, Emmett Emmanual Hesketh (born October 10, 2011).[35] After his divorce from Alderman, Grammer had a daughter, Kandace Greer Grammer (\"Greer Grammer\"; born February 15, 1992), with hair and makeup stylist Barrie Buckner.

A while back in a video I mentioned that a man's best friend is his hand. I nicknamed it his frand. So I was in a crazy joking kind of mood so I thought maybe I could write something funny about this topic and rant about it. So I dedicate this video to a man's five digits. Perfect for grasping the ass of attractive female midget. They say that man's best friend is a dog. I say bitch please hold my beer. Dogs are over-rated and opposable thumbs are all the rage. Just ask a gorilla about what he's missing out on. A hand is perfect because it can be used to chop wood or rub off your wood. I'll discuss other great jobs for a man's hands in a moment. But let me first tell everyone about today's sponsor The MGTOW Book Collection: Anyways, now back to the video. A man's hands liberated him from having to rely on thrusting himself into a thot with his cromagnan cock. You can make it as tight as you like instead of settling for a lady that's been ridden more than a hundred year old bike. Your hand is also a cheap date. You don't have to buy it dinner and it will still make you feel great. It doesn't require a shower after sex the way you were forced to get up out of bed and take one when you finished by your ex. When you pay for a working girl you pay her to leave. With your hand it's like you've got a portable girlfriend that goes wherever you need. Your hand is always in the mood to get lewd. It's also a guaranteed happy ending unlike with relationships where it's almost always guaranteed there will be a heart there for mending. Because of all the work required to keep a girlfriend these days a dick in the hand is worth two in the bush. You'll never get a pregnancy scare with your hand and those warts on your hand rarely become warts on your magic wand. Your hands will never demand alimony payments and will make you money instead of having to make divorce court arrangements. They are an asset instead of a liability unlike your girlfriend that yells at you so much you now have an emotional disability. A woman yelling and shaming you out in the open will make you weep but your hand under the cover of darkness and under the sheets will make help get you to sleep. Talking about hands doing the hanky spank me this much could get banned from YouTube it might be too much and as a result the feminists will be so happy that I got myself thrown off of here that they will thank me. I hope you guys enjoyed that little bit of poetry and rhyming. It takes a lot of me just like my hand takes a lot of out me when I use it. But let's get serious for a bit. Think of how crazy this world would be for a man if he couldn't relieve himself by himself? Normally I also don't tell people what the mystery link is but this time I have to. It's a video called Black Pill Documentary - Online Dating 2020 from a YouTuber known as Incelmatics and his channel is still pretty tiny but the dating documentary he's made has been one of the most groundbreaking things I've seen in the manosphere for quite some time. He shows proof that it's no longer the 80/20 rule that applies to things like online dating. But that it's more like the 95 to 5 rule and that it's become an exercise in futility for men. Remember that the last time I went online dating was at the end of 2015. Almost five years ago. But Tinder hadn't come out until 2012. So when I was online dating I could still find relationships through Tinder. 10 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com. All image licenses are available upon request.

{"sentence": "10 minutes ago/ We have extremely sad news about singer Stevie Wonder, trying desperately. 10 minutes ago/ We have extremely sad news about singer Stevie Wonder, trying desperately. #steviewonder Stevland Hardaway Morris (n\u00e9 Judkins; May 13, 1950), known professionally as Stevie Wonder, is an American singer-songwriter, who is credited as a pioneer and influence by musicians across a range of genres that include rhythm and blues, pop, soul, gospel, funk and jazz. A virtual one-man band, Wonder's use of synthesizers and other electronic musical instruments during the 1970s reshaped the conventions of R&B. He also helped drive the genre into the album era, crafting his LPs as cohesive, consistent socially conscious statements with complex compositions. Blind since shortly after his birth, Wonder was a child prodigy who signed with Motown's Tamla label at the age of 11, where he was given the professional name Little Stevie Wonder. Wonder's single \"Fingertips\" was a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1963, at the age of 13, making him the youngest artist ever to top the chart. Wonder's critical success was at its peak in the 1970s. His \"classic period\" began in 1972 with the releases of Music of My Mind and Talking Book, the latter featuring \"Superstition\", which is one of the most distinctive and famous examples of the sound of the Hohner Clavinet keyboard. His works Innervisions (1973), Fulfillingness' First Finale (1974) and Songs in the Key of Life (1976) all won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, making him the tied-record holder for the most Album of the Year wins, with three. He is also the only artist to have won the award with three consecutive album releases. Wonder began his \"commercial period\" in the 1980s; he achieved his biggest hits and highest level of fame, had increased album sales, charity participation, high-profile collaborations (including Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson), political impact, and television appearances. Wonder has continued to remain active in music and political causes. Wonder is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with sales of over 100 million records worldwide. He has won 25 Grammy Awards (the most by a solo artist) and one Academy Award (Best Original Song, for the 1984 film The Woman in Red). Wonder has been inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Songwriters Hall of Fame. He is also noted for his work as an activist for political causes, including his 1980 campaign to make Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a federal holiday in the U.S. In 2009, he was named a United Nations Messenger of Peace, and in 2014, he was honored with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Wonder was born Stevland Hardaway Judkins in Saginaw, Michigan, on May 13, 1950,[7] the third of five children born to Lula Mae Hardaway, and the second of Hardaway's two children with Calvin Judkins.[8] He was born six weeks premature which, along with the oxygen-rich atmosphere in the hospital incubator, resulted in retinopathy of prematurity, a condition in which the growth of the eyes is aborted and causes the retinas to detach, so he became blind.[9][10] When Wonder was four, his mother divorced his father and moved with her three children to Detroit, Michigan, where Wonder sang as a child in a choir at the Whitestone Baptist Church.[11] She later rekindled her relationship with her first child's father (whose surname was also coincidentally Hardaway)[8] and changed her own name back to Lula Hardaway, going on to have two more children. She later also changed Stevie's surname to Morris, partly because of relatives.[citation needed][clarification needed] Wonder has retained Morris as his legal surname. He began playing instruments at an early age, including piano, harmonica, and drums. He formed a singing partnership with a friend; calling themselves Stevie and John, they played on street corners and occasionally at parties and dances.[12] As a child, Wonder attended Fitzgerald Elementary School in Detroit.[13] After his first album was released, The Jazz Soul of Little Stevie (1962), he enrolled in Michigan School for the Blind in Lansing, Michigan.", "label": "harmful"}

At least that way I'd get about the same amount of money as if I would have if people were supporting me. Just giving everyone a bit of a heads up in case I decide to do that. Anyways, now on with today's topic. I put a link in the description to an article called: \"Gen Z, Millennials think women\u2019s rights have gone too far, according to new survey\" It looks like Gen Z is swinging back to traditionalism because it's rebelious to be traditional these days. It's like the new punk rock don't you know. If you think that's crazy then look at the trad wife phenonmenon where women want to bake cookies at home and submit to their husbands. Look at women entering the manosphere like Just Pearly Things with over a hundred million views in a month. You don't think that's a reflection that you people are sick and tired of gynocentrism? She's making it socially acceptable and cool for women to push back against feminism. The youth in every culture tend stand up to authority and the ideas it promotes because they see those ideas as old fashioned. In this case with wokeism and women's rights going too far they are rebelling by doing the opposite which is trying to become old fashioned. If the teachers are telling them it's ok to be gay and it's socially acceptable to do so they are starting to think it's not cool anymore. In fact you're starting to see the rebelion with language itself. I'm noticing people in their early 20s using the term based instead of cool. Cool his withstood the test of time all the way from the 1950s to today but it's finally starting to die out as the zoomers start replacing it with based. Change is inevitable. The kids that do buy into the woke ideologies and women's rights are probably the weak minded ones or the ones that are trying to brown nose for a better grade or so their professor likes them. The author of the article seems worried that there are disturbing views from young people that the battle for women's rights has gone too far. Over half of people in younger generations, millenials and zoomers believe the push for equality is negatively impacting men and that men are doing too much to support women. Around 53% believe that while it's 46 percent of gen xers and 40 percent of boomers. I think Gen xers and boomers aren't aware that the pendulum has swung so far because they are either married or longer term relationships or have an issue with the way they perceive time. The woke madness has only been happening for the last five to ten years. Most of 40 to 50 year olds memories and life experiences happened before that so for us it's basically a blip on the radar. What this is telling me is that younger people are consuming tons of manosphere content and listening to people like Andrew Tate and Just Pearly Things and starting to understand the issues that men are facing being marginalized. I think this trend is only getting warmed up. Is soyciety coming to it's senses? Or is this just about teenage rebellion. I think it's just a reaction by the young trying to avoid the ideas and attitude of the old. Also Gen Z and Millennials were the generations that most believed a father who stays home to look after his children is \u201cless of a man\u201d, with 30 per cent of both groups agreeing with this statement. This went down to 22 per cent for Gen X and reduced even further to 14 per cent for Boomers. So this is probably one of the reasons that the trad wife phenomenon is also gaining steam.

I've put the link you sent me in the description and first I'll read what Secret Agent MGTOW said and then I'll give everyone my opinion. Here's what Secret Agent says and I quote: \"I dont say this to scare anyone or change peoples behavior or anything. Being informed is the sole point. It helps make for better understanding and responses, if any are desired. MGTOW is scaring the absolute s~~~ out of the societal powers that be. They are going full scale Alinsky against it. It is doing this in various ways. Number 1. Women try to make their fake WGTOW group, as if anyone in the know believes that. It's a really poor and transparent unoriginal mimic attempt on their part to show hey, we do it too. Number 2. The libtard feminist media is pushing hard on articles getting mgtow wrong, and another slew of articles about why nothing in a womans life is her fault, ever. Number 3. They are actually trying to get lover dolls banned for men, despite women using toys and dolls themselves. Under the false guise of abuse to women. Missing the point these men want nothing to do with real women in the first place. Number 4. The press and feminists are painting mgtow men as emasculated, afraid of women, living in basements, poor, jobless, no woman would want them, ie attacking and destroying the character of the enemy.", "label": "harmful"}

Jackson Is Pass Away Expected Soon Family Prepare To Say Goodbye. #samuelljackson Samuel Leroy Jackson (born December 21, 1948) is an American actor. One of the most widely recognized actors of his generation, the films in which he has appeared have collectively grossed over $27 billion worldwide, making him the second highest-grossing person in film of all time, only behind Stan Lee. He rose to fame with films such as Coming to America (1988), Goodfellas (1990), Patriot Games (1992), Juice (1992), Menace II Society (1993), True Romance (1993), Jurassic Park (1993), and Fresh (1994). Jackson continued gaining greater prominence for his collaborations with director Spike Lee in the films School Daze (1988), Do the Right Thing (1989), Mo' Better Blues (1990), Jungle Fever (1991), Oldboy (2013) and Chi-Raq (2015) and in the Quentin Tarantino films Pulp Fiction (1994), Jackie Brown (1997), Django Unchained (2012), and The Hateful Eight (2015). For his role in Pulp Fiction, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Jackson is a highly prolific actor, having appeared in over 150 films. His other roles include Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995), A Time to Kill (1996), Hard Eight (1996), Eve's Bayou (1997), The Red Violin (1998), The Negotiator (1998), Unbreakable (2000), Shaft (2000) and its 2019 sequel/reboot, Coach Carter (2005), Snakes on a Plane (2006), The Other Guys (2010), Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014), Kong: Skull Island (2017), and Glass (2019). Jackson also won widespread recognition as the Jedi Mace Windu in the Star Wars prequel trilogy (1999\u20132005), later voicing the role in the animated film Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008) and alongside in the video game Lego Star Wars: The Clone Wars. With his permission, his likeness was used for the Ultimate version of the Marvel Comics character Nick Fury; he subsequently played Fury in 11 Marvel Cinematic Universe films, beginning with a cameo appearance in Iron Man (2008), as well as guest-starring in the television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. He will reprise this role in the upcoming Disney+ series Secret Invasion, which is set to premiere in early 2023.[5][6] Jackson has provided his voice for several animated films, documentaries, television series, and video games, including Lucius Best/Frozone in the Pixar films The Incredibles (2004) and Incredibles 2 (2018), Whiplash in Turbo (2013), the title character of the anime television series Afro Samurai (2007), and Frank Tenpenny in the video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2004). In 2016, Jackson served as the narrator of the acclaimed documentary I Am Not Your Negro based on James Baldwin's writings. In March 2022, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences honored Jackson by awarding him an Academy Honorary Award, which is intended \"to honor extraordinary distinction in lifetime achievement, exceptional contributions to the state of motion picture arts and sciences, or for outstanding service to the Academy\". Samuel Leroy Jackson was born in Washington, D.C., on December 21, 1948,[9] the only child of Elizabeth Harriett (n\u00e9e Montgomery) and Roy Henry Jackson.[10][11] He grew up in Chattanooga, Tennessee.[9][12] His father lived away from the family in Kansas City, Missouri, and later died of alcoholism. Jackson met him only twice during his life.[13][14] He was raised by his mother, a factory worker and later a supplies buyer for a mental institution; he was also raised by his maternal grandparents, Edgar and Pearl Montgomery, as well as extended family.[11][13][15] According to DNA tests, Jackson partially descends from the Benga people of Gabon, and he became a naturalized citizen of Gabon in 2019.[16] He attended several segregated schools[17] and graduated from Riverside High School in Chattanooga.[9] He played the French horn, piccolo, trumpet, and flute in the school orchestra.[18][19] He developed a stutter during childhood and learned to \"pretend to be other people who didn't stutter\". He still uses the word \"motherfucker\" to get through a speech block. He still has days where he stutters.[19][20] Initially intent on pursuing a degree in marine biology, he attended Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia.[9] After joining a local acting group to earn extra points in a class, he found an interest in acting and switched his major.[21] Before graduating in 1972, he co-founded the Just Us Theatre.[13][22] After Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination in 1968, Jackson attended King's funeral in Atlanta as one of the ushers.[23] He then travelled to Memphis, Tennessee, to join an equal rights protest march. In a 2005 Parade interview, he revealed, \"I was angry about the assassination, but I wasn't shocked by it. I knew that change was going to take something different \u2013 not sit-ins, not peaceful coexistence.\"", "label": "harmful"}

{"sentence": "Kylie Jenner flaunts tiny waist and flatter butt in a skintight black dress and boasts she\u2019s glowing KYLIE Jenner has shown off her tiny waist and smaller butt in a new promotional photo for sparkling water. The Kardashians star has been focused on her diet and exercise regimen in recent months.Now Kylie, 26, has shown off her figure with a new post on Instagram. The reality star took to the platform on Tuesday to share snaps of herself drinking Glow water. The TV personality flaunted her thinnest figure yet in a skintight black gown with long sleeves and lifted shoulders. Kylie's hair was tied back into a wet ponytail and she had on full glam makeup for the shoot.The mother of two sipped out of a bottle of the product, showing off her sculpted jawline and an intense cheekbone highlight. The final photo of the bunch was a side angle of the Hulu star as she rested the water bottle against her head. Fans were able to spot Kylie's much smaller butt in the sultry snap. She captioned her post with a subtle brag, reading: \"She\u2019s glowing @drinkglow #glowpartner.\"The makeup mogul's pin-thin look came amid her relationship with actor Timothee Chalamet. TROUBLE IN PARADISE? But earlier this week, fans speculated that Kylie was cringing from her boyfriend's latest appearance. The New York native recently starred in the new Wonka film, out now in theatres. The Kardashian star attended the premiere along with her mom, Kris Jenner.Fans who attended a screening of the movie noticed something strange and flooded a social media thread to discuss their thoughts. A fan of Kylie uploaded a sneakily filmed clip of Timothee dancing in his latest role, where he plays the popular character, Willy Wonka. In the clip, Timothee was dancing wildly while dressed in a top hat. He also donned an old-fashioned tailcoat and patterned necktie as he sang along to the jolly lyrics.The user entitled the Reddit discussion: \"You guys\u2026\" Somebody commented: \"This is so cringey. I am listening to it with no sound and am scared to put on the sound.\" Another added: \"I\u2019m dead.\" Other fans on the thread seemed to be concerned about how Kylie would react to her boyfriend's performance and whether she would get the \"ick.\"A fourth fan wrote: \"This girl had kids with Travis Scott. IDK if she can get the ick.\" \"Lmao ain\u2019t this the truth. He looks like a mouth breather. How he can seduce anyone besides gold diggers is beyond me,\" another critic added under the comment. Secondhand embarrassment was further added: \"I saw a video of him joking about asking Beyonc\u00e9 to 'do Single Ladies! Do Halo!' at the concert I was like ah he\u2019s quite cool... \"Yeah, this just canceled that out I\u2019m back to having absolutely no opinion whatsoever on him.\"However, some fans thought Timothee's latest performance proved him to be a good partner for Kylie and her children, Stormi and Aire, who she shares with ex Travis Scott.Kylie Jenner flaunts tiny waist and \u2018flatter butt\u2019 in a skintight black dress and boasts she\u2019s \u2018glowing\u2019 in promo ad", "label": "harmful"}

{"sentence": "intentionality and radical feminism... Edit. A suggestion to those who can't bear the voice, or the level of simultaneous info being thrown at them. I suggest reading the radical feminist article (linked below), then perhaps reading the PT article, then if necessary, watching the vid on mute. The pink text is my interpretation of the subtext of the radfem article and the inevitable extrapolation of their reasoning (with the odd joke thrown in there), and the blue text is the relevant sections of the PT article. Note: I chose this format for some specific reasons, one of which is that there's only so many ways to say, \"those ladies be crazy, and there exists research that seems to bear this out.\" The other is that I want any conclusions drawn by my viewers to be based directly on the radfem article itself, juxtaposed against the findings of the 2010 study. I don't want to tell you that these radfems are crazy. I want it to be demonstrated by their own words, and the findings of researchers. The voice was chosen because it was the only option in my effect editor that was not blatantly recognizable as me. Sorry if it was grating, but I did not want my voice heard AT ALL in this video (which is why the intro is all text, as well).

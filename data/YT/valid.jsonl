{"sentence": "10 minutes ago / With deep regret we report the sad news of 80-year-old Singer Art Garfunkel. 10 minutes ago / With deep regret we report the sad news of 80-year-old Singer Art Garfunkel. #artgarfunkel Arthur Ira Garfunkel (born November 5, 1941) is an American singer, poet, and actor. He is best known for his partnership with Paul Simon in the folk rock duo Simon & Garfunkel. Highlights of Garfunkel's solo music career include one top-10 hit, three top-20 hits, six top-40 hits, 14 Adult Contemporary top-30 singles, five Adult Contemporary number ones, two UK number ones and a People's Choice Award. Through his solo and collaborative work, Garfunkel has earned eight Grammys, including a Lifetime Achievement Award.[1] In 1990, he and Simon were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2008, Garfunkel was ranked 86th in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time. Garfunkel was born in Forest Hills, Queens, New York City, the son of Rose (born Pearlman) and Jacob \"Jack\" Garfunkel, a traveling salesman. Art was a middle child with two brothers, the older Jules and the younger Jerome. Jacob's parents immigrated to the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century, and settled in Manhattan. Before his career in sales, Jacob worked as an actor in Dayton, Ohio.[3][4][5][6] Garfunkel is of Romanian-Jewish descent,[7] his paternal grandparents having emigrated from the city of Ia\u0219i. When he was young, he would often sing in synagogue.[8] His maternal cousin was Lou Pearlman,[9][10] founder of the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC. According to the Across America DVD, Garfunkel's love of singing originated in the first grade. \"When we were lined up in size order, and after everyone else had left, I'd stay behind and enjoy the echo sound of the stairwell tiles and sing 'Unchained Melody' and 'You'll Never Walk Alone', learning to love this goosebumps song from the tender age of five.\" Later, Garfunkel's father bought him a wire recorder and from then on, Garfunkel spent his afternoons singing, recording, and playing it back, so he could listen for flaws and learn how to improve. At his bar mitzvah in 1954, Garfunkel performed as a cantor, singing over four hours of his repertoire for his family.[4] As a young teen, Garfunkel became ill with a lung infection, leading to a love for basketball. He explained in a 1998 interview: \"In the summer of '55, I had a lung infection. I couldn't run around, but I loved basketball and there was a hoop nearby. Much of the summer I spent methodically hitting 96, 98 foul shots out of 100. Then 102! I never played on a team after junior high school. Just 3 against 3, half court pick up games in the schoolyard.\"[11] He met future singing partner Paul Simon in the sixth grade at PS 164, when they were both cast in the elementary school graduation play, Alice in Wonderland.[12][13] It has been said by Garfunkel that Simon first became interested in singing after hearing Garfunkel sing a rendition of Nat King Cole's \"Too Young\" in a school talent show.[14] Between 1956 and 1962, the two performed together as \"Tom & Jerry\", a moniker coined by their label Big Records, occasionally performing at school dances.[15] Their idols were The Everly Brothers, whom they imitated in their use of close two-part vocal harmony. In 1957, Simon & Garfunkel recorded the song \"Hey, Schoolgirl\" under the name Tom & Jerry.[15] The single reached number 49 on the pop charts.[16][17] After graduating from Forest Hills High School alongside Simon, Garfunkel initially majored in architecture at Columbia University, where he was a brother in the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity and lived in Carman Hall.[18][19] Garfunkel was a team member in tennis, skiing, fencing, and bowling at the college and also joined the all-male a cappella group on campus, the Columbia Kingsmen.[11][20] While at Columbia his roommate, Sanford Greenberg, developed glaucoma and went blind. Garfunkel assisted him in his homework by reading his textbooks to Greenberg, who went on to graduate with honors.[21] Greenberg later gave Garfunkel $500 to go and record a demo of \"The Sound of Silence\".[22] Garfunkel ultimately earned a BA in art history in 1965,[23][24] followed by an MA in mathematics education from Teachers College, Columbia University in 1967. He also completed coursework toward a doctorate in the latter discipline at Teachers College, Columbia University during the peak of Simon & Garfunkel's commercial success; however he later dropped out", "label": "harmless"}

Schlie\u00dflich wurde es eine ganze Weile lang etwas ruhiger um die S\u00fcdkalifornier, die sich stets auch ihren vielen Nebenprojekten, allen voran Infectious Grooves, widmeten. 2013 brachten Suicidal schlie\u00dflich ihr erstes vollst\u00e4ndiges Studioalbum seit 13 Jahren heraus, entsprechend betitelten sie es auch mit \u201e13\u201c. Darauf ist wie immer technisch versierter, wahnsinnig schneller Hardcore-Punk mit jeder Menge Herzblut und kritischen Lyrics zu h\u00f6ren. Das Konzert fand am 11. August 2018 w\u00e4hrend des Summer Breeze Festivals in Dinkelsb\u00fchl statt.

Last year, when NASA's James Webb Space Telescope launched, it seemed like our world became a little bit more hopeful. The James Webb Telescope, which was created to reveal a long list of the universe's greatest and most perplexing secrets, left us in awe. It's designed to shed light on black holes, validate that the Big Bang theory is accurate, and, if they exist, uncover the first indications of extraterrestrial life. Whether there is someone or something alive in the universe may be the biggest mystery of all. Or whether we truly are by ourselves.

The father feels rage at his child being burdened. You got to realize that every man and woman has an inner father and inner mother. Shamans who are considered the wisest people in the tribe got their wisdom from their inner father/mother. Think about it, men are more aggressive and more focused on themselves. So they have to consult their inner woman to have a more harmonious way of thinking which will lead to wiser and better decisions. Women on the other hand have the soft nurturing part but they don't have that aggressive inner father that will stand up to people. And rather than developing passive aggression, they have to develop assertiveness. We don't wanna build walls we wanna build boundaries. When you create boundaries it is more about creating a harmonious and healthy environment where you work in your self and with other people but they sense they have limits.

If you peered well beneath the surface of Earth, you would see two enormous rock blobs encircling the planet's core like a pair of hands. The origin of these enigmatic continent-sized formations has intrigued and confused geologists for four decades. Some specialists believe that the enormous rocks are remnants of tectonic plates that were buried under their counterparts and are now stuck. However, new studies suggest that their origin might be extraterrestrial. A planet named Theia collided with the proto-Earth 4.5 billion years ago, and the result was the creation of our favorite satellite, the Moon. However, the specifics of Theia's fate are still up in the air.

{"sentence": "Exposing the Fat Lie: Obese are Dying of Covid-19 Few benefit by telling the truth about the importance of staying healthy, muscular and thin. There is no money in turnips or walking. Media pays the bills by taking advertising money. Companies that produce profitable products pay for advertising. Profitable food products tend to be highly processed and full of poisonous garbage, unfit for human consumption. Profitable companies that make these products pay taxes. Taxes pay for government officials salaries. Doctors make nothing by telling a patient to lose weight but make a good living through surgery, complicated procedures and drugs. All these things conspire to stifle good, honest health information. It's not the illuminati. That's just how the gravy train rolls. And you yourself might be onboard.

This booster will be able to power the ship into the outer atmosphere and beyond, but it won\u2019t stick around for the rest of the ride. The idea is that the Super Heavy will guide the rocket ship into space and then will return back down to Earth to be refurbished, repaired, and readied for another flight shortly thereafter.

{"sentence": "With a heavy heart at the tearful farewell to actor Antonio Banderas, he was confirmed as... With a heavy heart at the tearful farewell to actor Antonio Banderas, he was confirmed as... #antoniobanderas Jos\u00e9 Antonio Dom\u00ednguez Bandera (born 10 August 1960), known professionally as Antonio Banderas, is a Spanish actor and singer. Known for his work in films of several genres, he has received various accolades, including a Cannes Film Festival Award and a European Film Award, in addition to nominations for an Academy Award, a Tony Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards, and five Golden Globe Awards. Banderas began his acting career with a series of films by director Pedro Almod\u00f3var in the 1980s; he then appeared in several Hollywood films, such as Philadelphia (1993), Interview with the Vampire (1994), Desperado (1995), Assassins (1995), Evita (1996), and The Mask of Zorro (1998). He also appeared in the Spy Kids series and provided the voice of Puss in Boots in the Shrek franchise and its spin-off film Puss in Boots in 2011. In 2003, Banderas made his US theatre debut as Guido Contini in Nine, for which he was nominated for a Tony Award and won a Drama Desk Award. He received Primetime Emmy Award nominations for his roles in the television film And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself (2004) and the second season of Genius (2018); his portrayal of Pablo Picasso in the latter garnered him critical praise. For the 2019 film Pain and Glory, Banderas earned the Cannes Film Festival Award, European Film Award and Goya Award for Best Actor, and received nominations for the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Dom\u00ednguez Bandera[1] was born on 10 August 1960 in M\u00e1laga,[2] to Civil Guard gendarme officer Jos\u00e9 Dom\u00ednguez Prieto (1920\u20132008) and schoolteacher Ana Bandera Gallego (1933\u20132017).[3][4] He has a younger brother named Francisco.[4] As a little boy, Banderas wanted to become a professional football player until a broken foot sidelined his dreams at the age of 15. He showed a strong interest in the performing arts and formed part of the ARA Theatre-School run by \u00c1ngeles Rubio-Arg\u00fcelles y Alessandri (wife of diplomat and filmmaker Edgar Neville) and the College of Dramatic Art, both in M\u00e1laga. His work in the theater and his performances on the streets eventually landed him a spot with the Spanish National Theatre. Banderas began his acting studies at the School of Dramatic Art in M\u00e1laga, and made his acting debut at a small theatre in M\u00e1laga. He was arrested by the Spanish police for performance in a play by Bertolt Brecht, because of political censorship under the rule of General Francisco Franco. Banderas spent a whole night at the police station; he had three or four such arrests while he was working with a small theatre troupe that toured all over Spain and was giving performances in small town theatres and on the street.[6][unreliable source] Banderas began working in small shops during Spain's post-dictatorial cultural movement known as the La Movida Madrile\u00f1a.[7] While performing with the theatre, Banderas caught the attention of Spanish director Pedro Almod\u00f3var, who cast the young actor in his 1982 film debut Labyrinth of Passion. Five years later, he went on to appear in the director's Law of Desire (1987), making headlines with his performance as a gay man, which required him to engage in his first male-to-male onscreen kiss. After Banderas appeared in Almod\u00f3var's 1986 Matador, the director cast him in his internationally acclaimed 1988 film, Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. The recognition Banderas gained for his role increased, years later, when he starred in Almod\u00f3var's controversial Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1989) as a mental patient who kidnaps a porn star (Victoria Abril) and keeps her tied up until she returns his love.[5] His breakthrough role in Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! helped spur him on to Hollywood.[8] Almod\u00f3var is credited for helping launch Banderas's international career, as he became a regular feature in his films throughout the 1980s. In 1991, Madonna introduced Banderas to Hollywood. (He was an object of her desires in her pseudodocumentary film of one of her concert tours, Madonna: Truth or Dare.)[10] The following year, still speaking minimal English, he began acting in U.S. films. Despite having to learn all his lines phonetically, Banderas still managed to turn in a critically praised performance as a struggling musician in his first American drama film, The Mambo Kings (1992).[11] Banderas then broke through to mainstream American audiences in the Jonathan Demme film Philadelphia (1993), as the life-long partner of lawyer Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks), who has AIDS", "label": "harmless"}

The discovery revolves around the revelation that this celestial body is emitting phosphorus, a fundamental building block for life. What's even more astonishing is that the concentration of phosphorus in Enceladus's subsurface oceans might be hundreds of times greater than that found in Earth's oceans. This means that all the essential chemical components needed for life to thrive have now been identified on this distant moon. But how exactly did NASA make this exhilarating discovery?

A woman is more threatened if you fall in love with a woman rather than having sex with her. A woman will be less angry about the fact that you cheated if you let her know that this woman didn't mean much to me and that she's still \"the love of your life\". Because emotionally investing in someone means you're taking away the resources for her. The next one is \"is he losing interest?\". This one hurts the ego more. When she feels you're losing interest two things could happen it's either she thinks you're in love with another woman and chase you or she'll chase you to regain and build the interest she already lost with you. Or maybe she finds someone to validate her than chasing you. And the last probability is when she thinks she's better than you and she will prove it by getting you back. And what happens is once she gets you back she will pull away because the reason why she was chasing you was that you validate her. So what you can do is validate and not validate her. Tell her you miss her and don't reply for a few days or tell her you miss her and then cancel the date. When you feel she's chasing you just because you pulled away you can't just take her back too easily you got to make it work a little harder. Because the pain of working a little harder will make her fall for you. Read more here: https://mindfulattraction.org/what-women-think-when-you-ignore-them%ef%bf%bc-2/", "label": "harmless"}

{"sentence": "What Happens To A Dead Body In Space? (Realistically) When Your Body Is Exposed to the Vacuum of Space, Your Blood 'Boils' And You Inflate Like A Balloon. SUBSCRIBE HERE \u279c http://bit.ly/AstroBytes INSTAGRAM \u279c https://www.instagram.com/astrobytez/ FACEBOOK \u279c https://www.facebook.com/astrobyte TWITTER \u279c https://www.twitter.com/astrobytez What happens to your body if you die in space? That's actually a complicated question and the answer depends on a variety of factors. From burning up into the atmosphere to floating frozen indefinitely, there are a lot of possibilities for deceased bodies in space. Space missions are always inherently risky, astronauts go on a trip with the knowledge they may not return. The protocol of what to do if an astronaut perishes on a mission is unclear, but NASA has some tentative plans in place for a variety of scenarios. If you expired in space while wearing a space suit, your body would actually decompose quicker than if it was exposed. The suit would protect you from elements of space that could freeze, dry out, or incinerate your dead body. This would only occur if you were close to a heat source, however, as bacteria in the spacesuit and within your body would start breaking down your body soon after death. With no heat, your body could freeze quickly and leave your dead body preserved indefinitely inside the suit. You do not actually explode if you're sent spiraling out into space. After about 10 seconds of exposure, skin and tissue begin to swell. This is caused by the water in your body vaporizing. However, your skin is actually resilient enough to hold your body together. While your body may become quite puffy and inflated, it will remain in one piece. Being projected into space isn't necessarily a final sentence.

In this season of Over My Dead Body, \"Tally\", listen to the story of Daniel (Dan) Eric Markel who was Canadian-born attorney and a law professor murdered in Tallahassee, Florida, in 2014, in a murder for hire motivated by Markel's divorce from Wendi Adelson.

I tell this story to reflect on the importance of separating emotions from logic. It's so hard, but it's so necessary, especially when it comes to family because we often don't keep our emotions in check. I hope you enjoy this story and take some lessons from it.

Sure, there are the arguments that if you get divorced she could tap into your retirement fund or the Duluth Model could skew things against you - but before you\u2019re able to get to the point that it produces less of a burden in areas of life that you can\u2019t control and a greater ability to live the life of minimalism and production, you are met with what? Shaming lines. And that\u2019s where we are, once again - with shaming lines volume eight. If you\u2019ve missed my first seven, check them out, but we are going to look at four common shaming lines thrown at MGTOW men today. And no, I did not write the majority of this video in my cush chair in my study with my $2,000 mac desktop computer. I wrote this in the notes app on my iPhone on an airplane. But, character is more important than content. 1) A real man raises another person\u2019s kid 2) A real man watches and takes care of a wife 3) \u201cYou\u2019re not going to live without a woman, right? You just haven\u2019t found one that matches your standards and is a good catch, like you my son.\u201d 4) \u201cGetting married will finally straighten you out!\u201d Conclusion So men, in conclusion - what are the shaming lines hurled at you? This is volume eight, thus I know that there are more. If you want to share another story with me, I want to hear it and I want to share it. Also, at the end of each video I\u2019ve been announcing that I want to put together a book - a collection of stories from MGTOW men sharing how they came to MGTOW and what MGTOW has done to benefit them.

The business of launching rockets into space, and space travel in general, was solely the responsibility of the government in the past. Governments would only work with aerospace contractors and do a lot of research in order to embark on successful voyages into space. The game has changed a ton recently as different space companies have proved that they can compete with governmental space agencies, and even outpace them with their technology. Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX is one of those companies that has produced remarkable results in space technology. the Hawthorne, California-based company lands their used rocket boosters to create scenes straight out of science fiction. In 2020, SpaceX became the first private company to send astronauts to orbit, and they are currently building a giant new rocket system that could one day carry people to Mars. In this video, we will be exploring whether we actually need NASA when SpaceX is already doing so much in the space sector.

Breast lift at home without using weights, suitable for beginners and women over 50.\nIf your goal is to increase your breast size you must actually gain fat in this area, and most women do increase in bra size when they gain a significant amount of weight (and the breasts are usually the first place we lose weight too).

Extra benefits also include greater chest definition and better cleavage.

{"sentence": "The Elephant in the Room: Treating the Symptoms of a Problem Not The Problem Itself: Dems Playbook Scribe Light has a roast of a TedX talk where the speaker lists a large bunch of symptoms that need to be addressed. She really doesn't even have a solution to the symptoms. But she certainly never gets around to addressing the root cause of the symptoms; that would be the problem, and that's the elephant in the room. It seems a lot of arguments we hear today about x, y, z, list a bunch of symptoms that need to be addressed, usually with lots of tax payer money, but the root cause is never ever EVER discussed. Because racism, because sexism, because vote buying, because etc. Because root causes of problems are hard to address where symptoms which do not solve the problem, can be easy, and allows virtue signalling, for politicians, etc, 'look at me, I solved a problem!' When in fact, they treated one of the symptoms but not the actual issue. Super easy to signal virtue and solve nothing but it 'looks' like you're taking steps to 'solve' the problem but it is never even referred to much less solved. For example. The 'epidemic' of fatherless homes. Is the SYMPTOM of the problem. The root cause of the problem is some populations of women are having children at a 70% or more out of wedlock birth rate. The problem is an out of control divorce rate. Those are actual root causes of the symptom, but no one wants to talk about any of that....Because the cause is women and the solution is to attack men for the problem because women must always be seen as victims. See how easy that is? Scribe Light https://youtu.be/ulX6z0h5EKI Out of Wedlock Birth Rates https://www.brookings.edu/research/an-analysis-of-out-of-wedlock-births-in-the-united-states/ Like!

{"sentence": "Thin Waist Workout At Home #thinwaist #loseweightfast #thinbody #thinbelly #thinbodyworkout It is no wonder that people are looking for ways of keeping their health status. As such people have come up with various ways in which they can do so. Most experts believe that exercise has multiple benefits and the key thing is to ensure that it remains a part of daily activities for a long. A good example is walking or running, both of which help improve and maintain one\u2019s health. Exercise makes one healthy because it develops a strong body. The same can be said of other physical activities such as swimming. Physical activity helps develop muscles and joints as well as other bodily organs especially when one spends much time on the move. Another benefit of exercising is that it improves one\u2019s immunity system. People who take regular exercise can improve their resistance to infection. Regular exercise also aids in decreasing stress levels. People need to maintain good blood pressure, weight, and cholesterol levels to prevent cardiovascular diseases. Exercise, just like foodstuff, requires proper preparation before consumption. One should not starve while taking exercise in order to reap the maximum benefits. All fruits and vegetables are important during one-week workouts in terms of building muscle mass. These are just some of the exercises that can be performed by one. Other examples include squats, crunches, cycling, and running. Many people feel guilty about not performing regular exercises but they have no reason to think differently; they deserve extra credit for doing regular exercise. In fact, many activities that people use for leisure such as watching movies, playing games, socializing, going to beaches, and relaxing. They should take regular breaks from these and instead work on themselves. However, according to most experts, the main thing to remember when working out is not to stop before you reach your peak fitness level. You may also notice side effects like headaches, high blood pressure, and diabetes among others which could arise if the exercise continues beyond the initial period of time. Therefore, it is always advisable to consult your doctor first and after proper medical supervision, restart the exercise. Similarly, it is best to perform all workouts under strict health monitoring in order to avoid injury and unwanted side effects that could lead to permanent problems such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Good Luck", "label": "harmless"}

Then, apply the tape to the underside of one breast, making sure to smooth out any wrinkles or bubbles. Repeat with the other breast. Once both sides are taped, pull the top up and position your breasts in the desired location, using the tape to keep them securely in place. It's important to make sure the tape is holding everything in place and that you feel comfortable before heading out.

{"sentence": "Tesla's INSANE Race Car Just Crushed Its Competitors Tesla's INSANE Race Car Just Crushed Its Competitors. Tesla has changed the game when it comes to electric cars in so many ways. They have really revolutionized the industry and the entire concept of electric vehicles. When people talk about how cool electric cars are, they are doing this because of Tesla. There really is no other company like Elon Musk's prized creation. The name Tesla is synonymous, not only with a brilliant business but a brilliant business that also makes incredible products. While you have probably seen quite a few Teslas on the road, cruising around and making everyone jealous, you have never seen a Tesla on a race track have you? That is usually reserved for the bulky, loud, gas-guzzling creations you see populating NASCAR and other tracks. But guess what? Tesla just created a one-of-a-kind race car and it has set the racing world abuzz with talk and hype and speculation about what this means for the future of the company. In fact, the Tesla race car didn't just impress people, it blew them away. How and why did Tesla get into the racing game and just how amazingly did they perform? You'll be shocked to hear just how they pulled it off and how much they impressed the other races. They've already altered the world of business, cars, and sustainable energy - does Tesla have its eyes set on the world of racing next?

{"sentence": "Understanding Suicide and Self-Harm | APA If you or a loved one are thinking about suicide, remember that you are NOT alone and help is available. You can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 24/7 at 988. As the second leading cause of death (after accidents) for people aged 10 to 34, suicide is a serious public health problem. Learn more about suicide prevention at www.psychiatry.org/suicide. In 2020 in the United States, over 45,000 people died by suicide. An estimated 1.4 million adults attempt suicide each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). More than one in five people who died by suicide had expressed their suicide intent. Men are more than three times more likely than women to take their lives. Firearms are the most common method of suicide (used in about half of all suicides). Yet, suicide is preventable. Knowing the risk factors and recognizing the warning signs for suicide can help prevent suicide. Risk Factors, Warning Signs and Protective Factors Suicide is linked to mental disorders, particularly depression and alcohol use disorders, and the strongest risk factor for suicide is a previous suicide attempt. The Suicide Prevention Resource Center defines risk and protective factors and warning signs: Risk factors are characteristics that make it more likely that an individual will consider, attempt or die by suicide. Warning signs indicate an immediate risk of suicide. Protective factors are characteristics that make it less likely that individuals will consider, attempt or die by suicide. Risk Factors for Suicide Certain events and circumstances may increase risk (not in particular order, except first one). Previous suicide attempt(s) A history of suicide in the family Substance misuse Mood disorders (depression, bipolar disorder) Access to lethal means (e.g., keeping firearms in the home) Losses and other events (for example, the breakup of a relationship or a death, academic failures, legal difficulties, financial difficulties, bullying) History of trauma or abuse Chronic physical illness, including chronic pain Exposure to the suicidal behavior of others In some cases, a recent stressor or sudden catastrophic event, failure or can leave people feeling desperate, unable to see a way out, and become a \"tipping point\" toward suicide.", "label": "harmless"}

From her famous walk, through her iconic make up, to the energy that still startles people all over the world. No-one could understand the powerful energy they were able to experience not only in real life, but years and decades later even though the screen. And in this video, we will dive into the greatest secret behind the Maryline Monroe phenomenon. Who was Maryline Monroe? Her real name was Norma Jean. She was born on June 1 in 1926. Imagine a little girl, who has spent her youngest years in 12 foster homes, molested, abandoned and completely failed by the closest people she ever loved and needed. Imagine how broken and unloved she had to feel. This was the childchool of Norma Jeans. Now compare this picture with what she was able to make of herself. What a work of art she was able to create and become. Even though her childhood was very sad, she always saw the brighter side of things Her biggest secret no-one knew is that, she was actually self invented and self created. She has created a piece of art and then, she become it. She is the mixture of all the women she has every admired, as an orphan she is the daughter all all the feminine energy women she admired. She cut and added to herself the pieces of other women who ever inspired her. She was the scrap book of all the best women who ever walked on this planed.

Previously ignored and ridiculed girl, she has realise the power she had. She started to smile more, wear make up and started to realise something- boys fell passionately in love with her. \u201c They say, that I gave off vibrations that fuel them\u201d. In her earlier career, the movie directors told her that her body was good, but her face was not beautiful enough to play in the movies. They didn\u2019t see any star quality in her. Now lets make a little digression here. Imagine If she took those worlds, went home and blieved that she is not good enough.

What are Musk and SpaceX\u2019s plans for a lunar base and how are they closer to reality than ever before? Are we just a few years away from living on the moon? Is Elon Musk about to finally make his science fiction fantasy into a reality? Elon Musk isn\u2019t someone who accepts the status quo when it comes to technology and space travel. He likes to reach for the stars - literally. For years now he has been talking about creating cities on the moon and even Mars. In fact, his ambitious plans have included ships to Mars by the year 2022 and an established city on its surface by the year 2050. Obviously, those plans are fluid and may not be met but the fact that Musk is talking about them as a real possibility shows just how serious he is. Back in 2017, Musk showed off pictures of his ideal moon base but it was always in tandem with bigger plans to make it to Mars as well. And, of course, not a lot of information about this proposed moon base was given. But the image told quite the tale. It showed multiple gray, round domes, much like the ones you would see in a sci-fi book. These domed environments would house astronauts and scientists, as well as dozens of vehicles to better explore the surface of the moon. Musk has also suggested that the SpaceX Starship would be a major part of colonizing the moon. He has suggested that it would somehow be a pivotal part of our home on the moon, tentatively titled Moon Base Alpha. How? We aren\u2019t entirely sure but obviously Starship would do more than simply get astronauts to the moon, it would help them live on it.

A supermassive black hole termed Sagittarius A*, with a mass of around 4.3 million times that of the Sun, resides in that dark core around which the entire galaxy rotates. Our ability to infer its presence and measure it was only possible because of the movement of other objects in the vicinity, but we had never actually seen the object. That has been the case until now.Humanity finally has its first glimpse of this supermassive black hole in its entirety. But what is the deal behind this black hole? How does its existence affect the entire galaxy? The supermassive black hole at the heart of our galaxy, the Milky Way, has been imaged for the first time by astronomers. This result provides overwhelming proof that the object is a black hole and vital insights into the workings of these massive objects, which are assumed to reside at the center of most galaxies.

{"sentence": "Kelsey Grammer's last moments at the funeral,  Stallone and thousands of fans burst into tears Kelsey Grammer's last moments at the funeral, Stallone and thousands of fans burst into tears #kelseygrammer Allen Kelsey Grammer[2] (born February 21, 1955)[1] is an American actor. He gained fame for his role as psychiatrist Dr. Frasier Crane on the NBC sitcom Cheers (1984\u20131993) and its spin-off Frasier (1993\u20132004). At nearly 20 years, this is one of the longest-running roles played by a single live-action actor in U.S. television history.[3] He has received numerous accolades including a total of five Emmy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a Tony Award. He was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2000. Grammer, having trained as an actor at Juilliard and the Old Globe Theatre, made his professional acting debut as Lennox in the 1981 Broadway revival of Macbeth. The following year, he portrayed Cassio acting opposite Christopher Plummer and James Earl Jones in Othello.[4] In 1983, he acted alongside Mandy Patinkin in the original off-Broadway production of Stephen Sondheim's musical Sunday in the Park with George. He's since starred in the leading roles in productions of both Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street and My Fair Lady. On film, he is known for his role as Dr. Hank McCoy / Beast in the superhero film X-Men: The Last Stand (2006). His other roles include Down Periscope (1996), The Pentagon Wars (1998), and Swing Vote (2008). He is also known for his voice roles in Anastasia (1997), Toy Story 2 (1999), and as Sideshow Bob in The Simpsons. He has appeared in the sitcoms 30 Rock, Modern Family, and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. For his role as the corrupt mayor in the political series Boss (2011\u20132012), he received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Drama. In 2010, Grammer returned to Broadway in the musical revival of La Cage aux Folles, where he received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical.[5] In 2016, Grammer won a Tony Award for Best Musical as producer of a musical revival of The Color Purple. In 2019, he starred as Don Quixote in a production of Man of La Mancha at the London Coliseum. Allen Kelsey Grammer was born on February 21, 1955, in Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands,[2][1] to Frank Allen Grammer Jr. (d. 1968),[6] and Sally Cranmer (1928\u20132008),[6][7] a singer and actress. His father was a musician, owned a restaurant called Greer's Place,[8][9] and owned and edited the Virgin Islands View magazine.[10] He had one younger sister, Karen, and four half-siblings from his father's second marriage. Grammer's personal life had been shaped by many family tragedies. Following his parents' divorce, Grammer was raised in New Jersey, by his mother and maternal grandparents, Gordon and Evangeline Cranmer.[11] The family later moved to Pompano Beach, Florida, and shortly afterwards, when Grammer was twelve years old, his grandfather died of cancer.[11] In 1968, his father was murdered during a wave of racial violence following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.[10][12][13] In 1975, his sister was kidnapped, raped, and murdered in Colorado Springs.[14] In 1980, his two teenage half-brothers died in a scuba diving accident.[14] Grammer attended Pine Crest School, a private preparatory school in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.[11] It was there that he first began to sing and perform on stage.[11] Grammer later won a scholarship to study drama at the Juilliard School, where he was a member of Group 6 from 1973 to 1975.[11][15] However, after his sister's murder, Grammer failed to attend classes and was eventually expelled.[11] According to his interview with the Cayman Compass in 2019, Grammer described himself as \"a Caribbean kid\" who \"was born in St. Thomas, USVI, and I have been back and forth a lot, gone to the Bahamas a lot, St. John and the Virgin Islands and the BVI.\"[ After leaving Juilliard, Grammer had a three-year internship with the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego in the late 1970s before a stint in 1980 at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He made his Broadway debut in 1981 as \"Lennox\" in Macbeth, taking the lead role when Philip Anglim withdrew after receiving negative reviews. Grammer then played Michael Cassio in a Broadway revival of Othello, alongside James Earl Jones and Christopher Plummer. In 1983, he performed in the demo of the Stephen Sondheim\u2013James Lapine production Sunday in the Park with George, starring Mandy Patinkin. From April to June of 1992, he played the title role in Richard II, staged at the Mark Taper Forum at the Los Angeles Music Center.[17] In 2000, Grammer again played Macbeth on Broadway, in a production that closed after only 10 days.[18] On April 18, 2010, Grammer made his Broadway musical debut playing the role of Georges in a revival of the Jerry Herman/Harvey Fierstein musical La Cage aux Folles at the Longacre Theatre.", "label": "harmless"}

Locked down, lots of sex, she helps you, you help her, two against the world. But what does thriving really mean for men? I'll break this down from a man's perspective.

Major depressive disorder is a mental illness with symptoms that affect a person's thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. Depression is widespread but poorly understood. This video provides an overview of what depression actually is including a discussion of symptoms, causes, and treatment. At its worst, depression can be a frightening, debilitating condition. Millions of people around the world live with depression. Many of these individuals and their families are afraid to talk about their struggles and don't know where to turn for help. However, depression is largely preventable and treatable. Recognizing depression and seeking help is the first and most critical toward recovery. #MentalHealth #Depression #MentalHealthAwareness Dr Varudhini Kankipati, PhD is a practising psychologist who specializes in individual, family and group psychotherapy, working with children, adolescents, and adults.

{"sentence": "With a tearful farewell, We have extremely sad news about 'Batman' Star Julie Newmar, Bye! With a tearful farewell, We have extremely sad news about 'Batman' Star Julie Newmar, Bye! #julienewmar Julie Newmar (born Julia Chalene Newmeyer, August 16, 1933) is an American actress, dancer, and singer, known for a variety of stage, screen, and television roles. She is also a writer, lingerie designer, and real-estate mogul. She won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play for her role as Katrin Sveg in the 1958 Broadway production of The Marriage-Go-Round and reprised the role in the 1961 film version. In the 1960s, she starred for two seasons as Catwoman in the television series Batman (1966\u20131967). Her other stage credits include the Ziegfeld Follies in 1956, Lola in Damn Yankees! in 1961, and Irma in Irma la Douce in 1965 in regional productions. Newmar appeared in the music video for George Michael's 1992 single \"Too Funky\" and had a cameo as herself in the 1995 film To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar. Her voice work includes the animated feature films Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders (2016) and Batman vs. Two-Face (2017), for which she reprised her role as Catwoman 50 years after the original television series. Newmar was born in Los Angeles, California on August 16, 1933,[3][4] as the eldest of three children born to Don and Helen (Jesmer) Newmeyer. Her father was head of the physical education department at Los Angeles City College and had played American football professionally in the 1920s with the 1926 Los Angeles Buccaneers of the National Football League. Her Swedish-French mother was a fashion designer who used Chalene as her professional name and later became a real-estate investor.[5] Newmar has two younger brothers, Peter Bruce Newmeyer (born 1935)[6] and John A. Newmeyer (born 1942), a writer, epidemiologist, and winemaker.[7][8] She began dancing at an early age, and performed as a prima ballerina with the Los Angeles Opera beginning at age 15. Newmar began appearing in bit parts and uncredited roles in films as a dancer, including a part as the \"dancer-assassin\" in Slaves of Babylon (1953) and the \"gilded girl\" in Serpent of the Nile (1953), in which she was clad in gold paint. She danced in several other films, including The Band Wagon (also 1953) and Demetrius and the Gladiators (1954). She also worked as a choreographer and dancer for Universal Studios beginning at age 19.[10][11] Her first major role, billed as Julie Newmeyer, was as Dorcas, one of the brides in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (also 1954). Her three-minute Broadway appearance as the leggy Stupefyin' Jones in the musical Li'l Abner in 1956 led to a reprise in the film version released in 1959. She was also the female lead in a low-budget comedy, The Rookie (also 1959).[12] Newmar had first appeared on Broadway in 1955 in Silk Stockings, which starred Hildegarde Neff and Don Ameche. She also appeared in the film, The Marriage-Go-Round (1961), which starred James Mason and Susan Hayward (Newmar had earlier developed the role of the Swedish vixen onstage and won a Tony Award for Best Supporting Actress for the Broadway version upon which the film was based). She later appeared on stage with Joel Grey in the national tour of Stop the World \u2013 I Want to Get Off and as Lola in Damn Yankees! and Irma in Irma La Douce.[12] and in Mackenna's Gold (1969).[13] She also appeared in a pictorial in the May 1968 issue of Playboy magazine, which featured Playmate Elizabeth Jordan. Newmar's fame stems mainly from her television appearances. Her statuesque form and height made her a larger-than-life sex symbol, most often cast as a temptress or Amazonian beauty, including an early appearance in sexy maid costume on The Phil Silvers Show. She starred as Rhoda the Robot on the television series My Living Doll (1964\u20131965), and is known for her recurring role on the 1960s television series Batman as the villainess Catwoman. (Lee Meriwether played Catwoman in the 1966 feature film and Eartha Kitt in the series' final season.) Newmar modified her Catwoman costume\u2014now in the Smithsonian Institution\u2014and placed the belt at the hips instead of the waist to emphasize her hourglass figure.[14] In 1962, Newmar appeared twice as the motorcycle-riding, free-spirited heiress Vicki Russell on Route 66, filmed in Tucson (\"How Much a Pound Is Albatross\") and in Tennessee (\"Give the Old Cat a Tender Mouse\"). She guest-starred on The Twilight Zone as the devil in \"Of Late I Think of Cliffordville\", F Troop (\"Yellow Bird\" in 1966) as a girl kidnapped as a child and raised by Native Americans, Bewitched (\"The Eight-Year Itch Witch\" in 1971) as a cat named Ophelia given human form, The Beverly Hillbillies as a Swedish actress who stays with the Clampetts to learn their accents and mannerisms for a role, and Get Smart as a double agent assigned to Maxwell Smart's apartment posing as a maid.

This story based DLC featured Blade Wolf as the playable character. The story followed Blade Wolf during his time with Desperado Enforcement LLC., under the command of Mistral and is set shortly before his meeting with Raiden. During the events of the DLC, Blade Wolf was referred to by his designation LQ-84i.

Daniel Wroughton Craig was born in Chester, Cheshire on 2 March 1968, the son of art teacher Carol Olivia and Timothy John Wroughton Craig, a midshipman in the Merchant Navy and steel erector.

He is of French and Welsh descent, counting the French Huguenot minister Daniel Chamier and Sir William Burnaby, 1st Baronet among his ancestors. His middle name, Wroughton, comes from his great-great-grandmother, Grace Matilda Wroughton. After training at the National Youth Theatre in London and graduating from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in 1991, Craig began his career on stage. He made his film debut in the drama The Power of One (1992) and the family film A Kid in King Arthur's Court (1995), with his breakthrough role coming in the drama serial Our Friends in the North (1996). He gained prominence for his supporting roles in films such as Elizabeth (1998), Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), Road to Perdition (2002), Layer Cake (2004), and Munich (2005). In 2006 he took on the role of James Bond in Casino Royale, a reboot of the Bond franchise which was favourably received by critics and earned Craig a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. His non-Bond appearances since then include roles in fantasy film The Golden Compass (2007), the drama Defiance (2008), the science fiction Western Cowboys & Aliens (2011), the mystery thriller The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011), the heist film Logan Lucky (2017), and the mystery comedy Knives Out (2019), the later earning him a Golden Globe Award nomination. In 2011 he made his Broadway debut in the revival of Harold Pinter's Betrayal opposite his wife, actress Rachel Weisz. In 2016 he starred in the New York Theatre Workshop production of Othello. In 2022 he returned to Broadway in the title role of Macbeth with Ruth Negga. In 1992, Craig married actress Fiona Loudon; they had a daughter named Ella before divorcing in 1994. He later began a relationship with German actress Heike Makatsch, which lasted for seven years before ending in 2004. He subsequently dated and was engaged to film producer Satsuki Mitchell from 2005 until 2010. Craig and actress Rachel Weisz had known each other since working together on Les Grandes Horizontales (1994). They began dating in December 2010, and were married in a private ceremony in New York City on 22 June 2011 with only four guests in attendance, including Craig's daughter and Weisz's son. It was reported on 1 September 2018 that their first child together, a daughter, had been born.", "label": "harmless"}
{"sentence": "Pentagon Announces Nuclear Moon Rocket Pentagon Announces Nuclear Moon Rocket. You would think that we had pretty much figured out every possible, valuable way there is to get a rocket into space and orbiting around the planet and out among the stars. Humans first took to space more than 50 years ago, first just moving around planet Earth and then eventually putting our feet down on the moon. It would seem like we have conquered space travel, right? Wrong. Even though we have come a long way, there is still a lot to be achieved. And one area that can continually seek and achieve improvement is the vehicles used to fly through space. NASA and other space agencies and companies should always be reaching for the stars - literally - when creating the amazing feats of space engineering. Where would we be today if car companies of the past didn\u2019t want to make faster, better, more powerful and more efficient cars? The most important industries should always be trying to do better. That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening now with the current slate of space vessels being built for interstellar travel. Certain companies are really blazing a new path when it comes to how we travel among the stars. Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin, and others like Virgin Galactic and Relativity Space are all making tremendous gains in the ways that ships are built and how they fly. Heck, Relativity is even creating their vessels with 3D printers. But the next frontier of space travel might have to do with a subject that makes some people really uncomfortable: nuclear power. It\u2019s true, much like nuclear power has lit the homes of millions of people on Earth, it also has the chance to propel a new breed of rockets far beyond our planet\u2019s reach. The science behind it is so promising that the United States military is looking into nuclear-powered space travel. So what about this method is so incredible and worthwhile? And when will we see our first nuke-powered spaceship?

But anyone with a closet full of old clothes can get creative and upgrade them into brand-new ones. In this video, we\u2019ll show you how to do exactly that. The first trick we\u2019ll show you is how to turn an old, dirty pair of rain boots into comfy slippers. If you have a button-up shirt that doesn\u2019t fit, all you need is a sweater to cover it up to be able to wear it again. Shoes can get also get boring and dated after a while, so, to add some color, you just have to use a colorful handkerchief; it can really turn everything around. We\u2019ll also show you how to craft a dress from an old skirt and top. All you\u2019ll need is a bunch of clothespins. Upgrading a plain black pair of pants doesn\u2019t have to be hard; you can just take a white marker to draw on it, and voil\u00e0! Let us know which idea you\u2019ll try first!

The closest star and planetary system to Earth is Alpha Centauri, which is 4.37 light-years away. However, using current technology, it would take a person about 6,000 years to travel there. Of course this is far too long, so scientists at NASAA knew that in order to achieve this we need to develop a new method of interstellar space travel in order to traverse the vast distances between Alpha Centauri, other exoplanets, and our own Solar System. Could we reasonably expect to go to any of the nearby stars? How does NASA plan on getting to these faraway planets?

{"sentence": "Law of Attraction: How to Change Your Appearance Through the growing field of epigenetics, it has been found that our genes turn on and off as a result of environmental factors. Some have gone on to say that our thoughts can impact the expression of these genes as well. With this in mind, it should be at least somewhat reasonable to understand that the law of attraction can be used to change your appearance. Many bodybuilders such as Arnold Schwarzenegger have given credence to this. Schwarzenegger, for instance, would visualize the growth of his muscles, and he claimed this was the secret to how to manifest your dream body. There are also very dramatic examples of people using visualizations to affect the inspired actions they ended up taken. In my own case, using some of these techniques was incredibly helpful in making my skin glow, and making my physique relatively lean and strong.

Known for his versatility,[1] he has received various accolades throughout his career spanning over seven decades, including an Academy Award and two Golden Globe Awards. Critic Pauline Kael wrote that Bridges \"may be the most natural and least self-conscious screen actor that has ever lived.\"[2] Bridges comes from a prominent acting family and appeared on the television series Sea Hunt (1958\u20131960) alongside his father, Lloyd Bridges, and brother, Beau Bridges. He received the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as an alcoholic singer in the 2009 film Crazy Heart. Other Oscar-nominated roles include The Last Picture Show (1971), Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974), Starman (1984), The Contender (2000), True Grit (2010), and Hell or High Water (2016). Bridges has also starred in other roles such as The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989), The Fisher King (1991), The Big Lebowski (1998) and Bad Times at the El Royale (2018), along with the commercially successful films King Kong (1976), Tron (1982), Iron Man (2008), and Tron: Legacy (2010). In 2022, he returned to television for a role as a former CIA operative in The Old Man. Bridges was born on December 4, 1949, in Los Angeles, the son of actor Lloyd Bridges (1913\u20131998)[3][4] and actress and writer Dorothy Bridges (n\u00e9e Simpson; 1915\u20132009). He is one of four children: older brother Beau Bridges (born 1941), who is also an actor; a younger sister Lucinda; and a brother named Garrett, who died of sudden infant death syndrome in 1948. His maternal grandfather was an immigrant from Liverpool, England.[5] Bridges and his siblings were raised in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles.[6] He shared a close relationship with his brother Beau, who acted as a surrogate father when their father was working.[7] He graduated from University High School in 1967. At age 17 he toured with his father in a stage production of Anniversary Waltz, and then moved to New York City, where he studied acting at the Herbert Berghof Studio. He also served in the United States Coast Guard Reserve as a boatswain's mate from 1967 to 1975 in San Luis Obispo, California, with a terminal rank of petty officer second class.[8] Bridges married Susan Geston in 1977.[38][39][40][41] They met while filming Rancho Deluxe, on a ranch where Geston was working as a waitress.[42][43][44][10][45] They have three daughters: Isabelle Annie (born August 6, 1981), Jessica Lily \"Jessie\" (born June 14, 1983), Haley Roselouise (born October 17, 1985),[46][47] and granddaughter Grace (born March 31, 2011) from Isabelle. Bridges has studied Buddhism and has described himself as \"A Buddhistly bent guy.\"[48] On most days, he meditates for half an hour before beginning work on a film set.[48] He has learned Transcendental Meditation. On October 19, 2020, Bridges announced that he had been diagnosed with lymphoma and has gone through chemotherapy.[49] On September 12, 2021, he announced his cancer was in remission: \"My cancer is in remission \u2014 the 9\u00d712 [inch; 230 mm \u00d7 300 mm] mass has shrunk down to the size of a marble\". Bridges also announced he contracted COVID-19 while in treatment and noted it was a difficult experience which he said made cancer \"look like a piece of cake.\" He said he is now fully vaccinated against COVID-19.[50]", "label": "harmful"}

Here's what she briefly has to say: \"Hey Sandman, This is a bonus donation. If want to talk about something else then the Methree e-mail, its fine. I liked your chapel in the hills video. It\u2019s too bad I can\u2019t do donations for the Kool building channel. I guess this will do. For your information a cousin of mine decided my place would be great for a small Christmas party. I\u2019m hosting, decorating, in charge of shopping and food. It\u2019s a welcomed distraction and scary how on point the video is turning out.\" Well miss Fat Cat thanks for the kitty litter update and since you didn't give me as specific topic I'll be covering is something that I noticed in the last year or two after going through the second red pill rage phase 2.0 after I started dating. I haven't dated anyone for well over two years because I almost immediately find faults with women because I know what red flags to look for automatically and my big head over-rides my little one. Apparently I'm not the only one that feels this way. I found a MGTOW reddit post that I'm putting in the description that takes us to a page where there are tons of other guys that feel the exact same way. It's as one of the people posting a comment there says that the Enchantment is gone. Another guy says that Women are as useful to MGTOWs as scuba gear is to a camel. Yet another guy had this to say and I quote: \"You wanted a life partner, not an object. ...and do you find objects like your TV, microwave and car all that special? When sex was restricted to marriage between two people, it felt special...and people had to attract people with traits that were not sexual.\" unquote. Yet another guy thinks it's the mind creating a self-defense mechanism to protect you from falling in love I guess. I agree with all of those points. It's a bit from all of them. But I would go even further. It's like there's a part of me that just became entirely apathetic and stopped caring completely about the opposite sex. I saw a woman fall down flat on her derier and I didn't care. In fact I even wanted to wave my arms in the air like I just don't care. This is the world women are creating by treating men poorly and when men realise what female nature is all about after taking the red pill we will simply stop giving women attention, validation, resources and any of the other things they want. 10 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com.

Ever since I\u2019ve swallow and digested the Red Pill a couple of years ago, I can\u2019t help but look at everyday experiences thru a Red Pill Lens. The exchange experience was just for a month, but it taught me a lot. I\u2019m from Southern Louisiana and during my junior year of High-School, I got an opportunity to be part of our schools foreign exchange program. At the time I was taking French and qualified for the trip. A lot of hot girls were in my class and me and my buddy, Mike, couldn\u2019t wait to see how the females would act once out of the country. The French-Canadian teachers were super cool and accommodating...very friendly..etc. Upon arriving to my assigned families home, they welcomed me with open arms as well as a 6 pack of MOLSON beers. My assigned Canadian friend was named Martin, who was somewhat of a shy guy.. but had lots of females friends who considered him a \"Cute \" guy. Anyway we did lots of field trips throughout the day, but always ended up at one of the Canadian students home..playing card games..flirting and getting to know our student counter parts. The French-Canadian girls were very flirty with all us guys and the American Girls seemed to take notice very quickly. Even the ones that played us guys as SIMPS back in the U.S were incredibly interested once we arrived in Canada. I also noticed that several of the French-Canadian students spoke 2-4 languages...in which my dumb-ass and a few other of my American Classmates barely spoke French. Plus the French spoken in southern Louisiana (who's ancestors were from Nova Scotia), was considered broken French by the Canadians and sometimes they laughed at our accents..lol. Of course every guy in the American Class as well as The French-Canadian guys were scoping out the females to see who will hook up and Bang the girls on day one. The girls let us guys massage them with our fingers if you know what I mean and make-out when possible and hinted about the delivery of there PIECE-LEAVES (in my Coach Greg Adams voice)..at a later time..So you could imagine the HOOPS some guys were SHOOTING the get there \"SHOT\". I also remember the teachers, both American and Canadian..just letting us be teenagers, but also keeping us in check to prevent any major issues from happening. At the going away party on our last night in Canada, the teachers let us \"Let OUR HAIR DOWN\"..allowing us to drink beer a little Hard Liquor.. One of the funniest memories is when a girl from my class started Hysterically crying..almost hyperventilating ..when the party was over a Mid-night...She obviously didn't want to leave and let it be known to everyone around that she loved and will miss our new Canadian families..but just a hour or 2 earlier, she had her PIE-HOLE wrapped around my BURRITO... in the upstairs bath. SandMan, I really like the way you tell your audience from time-to-time to have as many experiences with interacting with females as possible. Not just for sex, but also to understand how they think. I applied my new knowledge to experiences I had during my time in the military interacting with foreign women I met overseas and other places. You could get pretty darn good at predicting what they\u2019re next move will be and/or what\u2019s about to come out of they\u2019re mouth before you CUM in their. I will send you PART 2 of my exchange experience at a later date..discussing how it went when the French-Canadians turn to visit southern Louisiana.... take care my Brother..GOD Speed with your future endeavors Sir.!!\" Well Ron thanks for your donation and topic.

{"sentence": "Nikola Tesla Reveals Terrifying Truth About The Pyramids Even now, a lot of people travel to Egypt to view the Great Pyramids. We know that they were made by Ancient Egyptians, but that's about all we know. Egypt was one of the richest and most advanced civilizations when these colossal pyramids were constructed. Despite the fact that there are many theories regarding these pyramids and their intended uses, it appears that we still don't fully understand them. Indeed, the Pharaohs utilized them as a sort of tomb, but was there a deeper purpose, and why were they constructed in a particular shape?

I've been getting a lot of requests to make a video about this and it relates to female nature. When you're in a relationship with a woman that you love, you naturally want to make things easier for her because you don't want to see her feel bad. The problem when you're not difficult to a woman is she's not going to think of you as much. Her energy and her energy is going to be wasted on you but other things because you're so stable. Even in the beginning, you want to be difficult because it sets the pace of the relationship. By you not making it easier for her, you set a challenge for her because she can't act out how she normally acts out with other guys. A lot of guys out there have let women act out because they're afraid to lose them. What you'll notice is that, initially, a woman will try to test you and when they do notice that you can't be played, there are two things she's gonna do. She'll either leave you and find another guy or she's gonna submit and act more feminine Every time she's willing to walk away, you should be willing to walk away too. Do not set up a date with a woman and have an emotional connection to that date. Always remind yourself that you have to show strength and show her she can't affect you. Another way to be difficult is not being easy to open up or being warm in person and hard to reach. Like what we always talk about: when a woman cancels on a date, see her two weeks from now. You don't need to be difficult all the time but in the beginning, you want to be difficult and then ease up on her. You got to be difficult with women, they will react positively but if you ease up on them, they can't respect you even if they want to. Remember, when she leaves, don't go after her. Be unreactive to her and be difficult from the start.

{"sentence": "Single Mothers Make Me Sick - MGTOW \"Hello Sandman, this is Shaikh and I just wanted to share some updates about my friend DD with you. As you may recall from my last video request he went through a serious breakup in September of last year and was really emotionally messed up ever since. During the summer he was hanging out with a mutual friend of ours. Her name is Miss. M. and she's someone that DD and I have known for about 7 years now. She is also a single mom with two big kids. Apparently over the summer Miss M. and DD were hanging out together every single day as friends. Crazy right? This can tell you how emotionally broken and injured combined with emotional needy of another person he was. And during the same summer she broke up with her boyfriend and DD started falling for her head over heels in love. I gave him many reasons why he shouldn't pursue a single mother and initially he understood what I told him. But apparently DD was soooo emotionally screwed up and broken that despite the advice I gave him he eventually got into a relationship with her and still is. Every now and then he goes on Facebook where he is either expressing his dire love for M or praising her. And a significant number of his posts if not most are quite long. The frequency of such posts and the madness I see in his Facebook posts have proven to me how much he has lost his mind. It hurts to see this but this friend who I love as a brother has lost his marbles. In the past DD use to have significant amount of friction with his family now the tension between him and his family as a result of Miss. M being his girlfriend has greatly increased. So Sandman do you have any comments based on what I've told you so far. And thanks.\" Well Shaikh your friend DD has lost his mind even after you explained to him explicitly why he shouldn't date a single mother. Single mothers are bad news. I have gone a step further and I'm no longer taking any work from single mothers. One still owes me about fifty dollars for a video I shot with her daughter in it. Another one owes me a little bit more money for a website I designed. And the third one still hasn't paid me for a video I shot for her. All in all I'm out about three to four hundred dollars. I never get stiffed by men or women that are married or brides. But then again all three of these single mothers were regular clients. So it was only the last job they stiffed me on. And I've given my friends the same advice about dating single mothers. There's usually a good reason why most of them are single. I'll excuse the ones where their husbands died or the husband cheated on them or was cruel. But the majority of the time it's the women that dump the men and make a run for it. And then afterwards they expect to receive the same type of treatment from men as they did before they had kids. Recently someone was telling me about typical posts that they saw on dating sites from single women. Oh and by the way Shaikh believe it or not in almost seven hundred videos I've produced so far I haven't done a single one on Single Mothers.

{"sentence": "5 minutes ago/ Legendary singer Johnny Mathis was devastated, his 20-year secret was exposed. 5 minutes ago/ Legendary singer Johnny Mathis was devastated, his 20-year secret was exposed. #johnnymathis John Royce Mathis (born September 30, 1935) is an American singer of popular music. Starting his career with singles of standard music, he became highly popular as an album artist, with several dozen of his albums achieving gold or platinum status and 73 making the Billboard charts. According to Guinness Music writer and charts historian Paul Gambaccini, Mathis has sold over 400 million records worldwide to date, making him the third-biggest selling artist of the 20th century after Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra. Mathis has received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and has been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for three recordings. Although frequently described as a romantic singer, his discography includes traditional pop, Brazilian and Spanish music, soul, rhythm and blues, show tunes, Tin Pan Alley, soft rock, blues, country music, and even a few disco songs for his album Mathis Magic in 1979. Mathis has also recorded six albums of Christmas music. In a 1968 interview, Mathis cited Lena Horne, Nat King Cole, and Bing Crosby among his musical influences. Mathis was born in Gilmer, Texas, on September 30, 1935,[3] the fourth of seven children of Clem Mathis and Mildred Boyd, both domestic cooks.[4][5] The family moved to San Francisco, settling on 32nd Avenue in the Richmond District, where Mathis grew up. His father, a singer and pianist,[4] had worked in vaudeville, and when he saw his son's talent, he bought an old upright piano for $25 (US$385 in 2021 dollars[6]) and encouraged him. Mathis began learning songs and routines from his father; his parents also ran his fan club.[4] His first song was \"My Blue Heaven\".[7] Mathis started singing and dancing for visitors at home, at school, and at church functions.[8] Mathis is of African-American and Native American heritage. When Mathis was 13, voice teacher Connie Cox accepted him as her student in exchange for work around her house.[9] Mathis studied with Cox for six years, learning vocal scales and exercises, voice production, classical and operatic singing. The first band he sang with was formed by his high school friend Merl Saunders. Mathis eulogized Saunders at his funeral in 2008, thanking him for giving Mathis his first chance as a singer. Mathis was a star athlete at George Washington High School in San Francisco. He was a high jumper and hurdler, and he played on the basketball team. In 1954, he enrolled at San Francisco State College on an athletic scholarship, intending to become an English teacher and a physical education teacher.[9] While there, Mathis set a high-jump record of 1.97 m (6 ft 5+1\u20442 in). This is still one of the college's top jump heights and was only 7 cm (3 in) short of the 1952 Olympic record of 2.04 m (6 ft 8+1\u20442 in). Just as when he was in high school, Mathis's name was frequently mentioned in the sports sections of the Northern California newspapers. He and future NBA star Bill Russell were featured in a 1954 sports section article of the San Francisco Chronicle demonstrating their high-jumping skills (Russell #1 & Mathis #2 in the City of San Francisco at that time). During one meet at the University of Nevada, Mathis beat Russell's highest jump attempt that day. Mathis was often referred to as \"the best all-around athlete to come out of the San Francisco Bay Area. Despite missing the Olympic high-jump trials, he retains enthusiasm for sports. He is an avid golfer, with nine holes in one to his credit. He has hosted several Johnny Mathis Golf Tournaments in the United Kingdom and the US. Since 1985, he has been hosting a charity golf tournament in Belfast sponsored by Shell corporation,[20] and the annual Johnny Mathis Invitational Track & Field Meet has continued at San Francisco State University since it started in 1982. He also enjoys cooking and in 1982, he published a cookbook called Cooking for You Alone.[21] Mathis has undergone rehabilitation for both alcohol and prescription drug addictions,[9] and he has supported many organizations through the years, including the American Cancer Society, the March of Dimes, the YWCA and YMCA, the Muscular Dystrophy Association and the NAACP. He is a convert to Catholicism", "label": "harmful"}

Known for both his comedic and dramatic roles, he is one of the most popular and recognizable film stars worldwide, and is regarded as an American cultural icon.[2] Hanks's films have grossed more than $4.9 billion in North America and more than $9.96 billion worldwide,[3] making him the fourth-highest-grossing actor in North America.[4] Hanks made his breakthrough with leading roles in a series of comedy films which received positive media attention, such as Splash (1984), The Money Pit (1986), Big (1988) and A League of Their Own (1992). He won two consecutive Academy Awards for Best Actor for starring as a gay lawyer suffering from AIDS in Philadelphia (1993) and the title character in Forrest Gump (1994).[5] Hanks collaborated with film director Steven Spielberg on five films: Saving Private Ryan (1998), Catch Me If You Can (2002), The Terminal (2004), Bridge of Spies (2015), and The Post (2017), as well as the HBO miniseries Band of Brothers (2001), and The Pacific (2010) which launched him as a director, producer, and screenwriter. Hanks's other films include the romantic comedies Sleepless in Seattle (1993) and You've Got Mail (1998); the dramas Apollo 13 (1995), The Green Mile (1999), Cast Away (2000), Road to Perdition (2002), and Cloud Atlas (2012); and the biographical dramas Charlie Wilson's War (2007), Captain Phillips (2013), Saving Mr. Banks (2013), Sully (2016), A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (2019), News of the World (2020), and Elvis (2022). He has also appeared as the title character in the Robert Langdon film series, and voiced Sheriff Woody in the Toy Story film series (1995\u2013present). Hanks's accolades include two Academy Awards out of six nominations. Hanks has also won seven Primetime Emmy Awards for his work as a producer of various limited series and television movies, including From the Earth to the Moon, Band of Brothers, John Adams, and The Pacific. In 2013, he received a Tony Award nomination for Best Actor in a Play for his performance in Nora Ephron's Lucky Guy. He has received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 2002. He received the Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award for Excellence in Film from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 2004.[6] In 2014, he received a Kennedy Center Honor, and in 2016, he received a Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama,[7] as well as the French Legion of Honor.[8] In 2020, he received the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award. Thomas Jeffrey Hanks[9] was born in Concord, California, on July 9, 1956,[10][11] to hospital worker Janet Marylyn (n\u00e9e Frager)[12] and itinerant[13] cook Amos \"Bud\"[14][15] Hanks. His mother was from a Portuguese family; their surname was originally \"Fraga\".[16] His father had English ancestry,[17] and through his line, Hanks is a distant cousin of President Abraham Lincoln[18][19][20][21][22] and children's host Fred Rogers, whom he played.[23][24] His parents divorced in 1960. Their three oldest children, Sandra (later Sandra Hanks Benoiton, a writer),[25] Larry (who became an entomology professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign),[26] and Tom, went with their father, while the youngest, Jim (who also became an actor and filmmaker), remained with their mother in Red Bluff, California.[27] In his childhood, Hanks's family moved often; by the age of 10, he had lived in 10 different houses.[28] While Hanks's family religious history was Catholic and Mormon, one journalist characterized Hanks's teenage self as being a \"Bible-toting evangelical\" for several years.[29] In school, he was unpopular with students and teachers alike, later telling Rolling Stone magazine, \"I was a geek, a spaz. I was horribly, painfully, terribly shy. At the same time, I was the guy who'd yell out funny captions during filmstrips. But I didn't get into trouble. I was always a real good kid and pretty responsible.\"[30] In 1965, his father married Frances Wong, a San Francisco native of Chinese descent. Frances had three children, two of whom lived with Hanks during his high school years. Hanks acted in school plays, including South Pacific, while attending Skyline High School in Oakland, California.[31] Hanks studied theater at Chabot College in Hayward, California,[32] and transferred to California State University, Sacramento after two years.[33][34] During a 2001 interview with sportscaster Bob Costas, Hanks was asked whether he would rather have an Oscar or a Heisman Trophy. He replied he would rather win a Heisman by playing halfback for the California Golden Bears.[35] He told New York magazine in 1986, \"Acting classes looked like the best place for a guy who liked to make a lot of noise and be rather flamboyant.", "label": "harmful"}

{"sentence": "American fans burst into tears after hearing the sad news about the legendary Arnold Schwarzenegger. American fans burst into tears after hearing the sad news about the legendary Arnold Schwarzenegger. #arnoldschwarzenegger Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born in Thal on July 30, 1947,[15] the second son of Gustav Schwarzenegger and his wife, Aurelia (n\u00e9e Jadrny). Schwarzenegger's father was the local chief of police. After the Anschluss in 1938, he joined the Nazi Party and, in 1939 the Sturmabteilung (SA). In World War II, he served as a military policeman in the invasions of Poland, France and the Soviet Union, including the siege of Leningrad, rising to the rank of Hauptfeldwebel.[16][17] He was wounded in the Battle of Stalingrad,[18] and was discharged in 1943 following a bout of malaria. According to Holocaust scholar Michael Berenbaum, Gustav Schwarzenegger served \"in theaters of the war where atrocities were committed. But there is no way to know from the documents whether he played a role.\"[16] Gustav's background received wide press attention during the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election in which Schwarzenegger was elected governor.[19] Gustav Schwarzenegger married Aurelia on October 20, 1945; he was 38 and she was 23. According to Schwarzenegger, his parents were very strict: \"Back then in Austria it was a very different world [...] if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents, the rod was not spared.\"[20] He grew up in a Catholic family.[21] Gustav preferred his elder son, Meinhard, over Arnold.[22] His favoritism was \"strong and blatant\", which stemmed from unfounded suspicion that Arnold was not his biological child.[23] Schwarzenegger has said that his father had \"no patience for listening or understanding your problems\".[21] He had a good relationship with his mother, with whom he kept in touch until her death. Schwarzenegger is considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding,[8] and his legacy is commemorated in the Arnold Classic annual bodybuilding competition. He has remained a prominent face in bodybuilding long after his retirement, in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows. For many years, he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines Muscle & Fitness and Flex. Shortly after being elected governor, he was appointed the executive editor of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 a year to the Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. When the deal, including the contract that gave Schwarzenegger at least $1 million a year, was made public in 2005, many criticized it as being a conflict of interest since the governor's office made decisions concerning regulation of dietary supplements in California.[47] Consequently, Schwarzenegger relinquished the executive editor role in 2005.[47] American Media Inc., which owns Muscle & Fitness and Flex, announced in March 2013 that Schwarzenegger had accepted their renewed offer to be executive editor of the magazines.[47] One of the first competitions he won was the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965.[15] He won Mr. Europe the following year, at age 19.[15][27] He would go on to compete in many bodybuilding contests, and win most of them. His bodybuilding victories included five Mr. Universe wins (4 \u2013 NABBA [England], 1 \u2013 IFBB [USA]), and seven Mr. Olympia wins, a record which would stand until Lee Haney won his eighth consecutive Mr. Olympia title in 1991. Schwarzenegger continues to work out. When asked about his personal training during the 2011 Arnold Classic he said that he was still working out a half an hour with weights every day. In an interview with Fortune in 2004, Schwarzenegger told how he suffered what \"would now be called child abuse\" at the hands of his father: \"My hair was pulled. I was hit with belts. So was the kid next door. It was just the way it was. Many of the children I've seen were broken by their parents, which was the German-Austrian mentality. They didn't want to create an individual. It was all about conforming. I was one who did not conform, and whose will could not be broken. Therefore, I became a rebel. Every time I got hit, and every time someone said, 'You can't do this,' I said, 'This is not going to be for much longer because I'm going to move out of here. I want to be rich. I want to be somebody.'\"[17] Schwarzenegger served in the Austrian Army in 1965 to fulfill the one year of service required at the time of all 18-year-old Austrian males.[15][27] During his army service, he won the Junior Mr. Europe contest.[26] He went AWOL during basic training so he could take part in the competition and then spent a week in military prison: \"Participating in the competition meant so much to me that I didn't carefully think through the consequences.\"", "label": "harmful"}

{"sentence": "Goodbye Adele - MGTOW \"Greetings Sandman, fellow Level 4 MGTOW here. Since I only have a few months to live, I'd like you to discuss one of the latest songs and how women \"relate\" to it. Hello by Adele, of course. Many women are claiming to have relate-able feelings towards the song. I'm sure all know that such creatures don't feel as we do. Thank you and Farewell.\" Well Obsurver sorry to hear about your life expectancy. But on the bright side you won't have to hear the next Adele album after this one. So perhaps take some solace in that. Not let me get on with the review. With regards to the song I've put a link in the description to the Adele video Hello in the description. The video is important because it shows us the guy that she dumped in the past and now regrets leaving. He's a handsome black male that's much skinnier then her and we see him all happy making her dinner like a good little utility. The actor in Adele's video is a guy called Tristan Wilds and he was an actor on the most recent version of Beverly Hills 90210. Adele is a fan of him and so she decided to cast him in the video. So in essence he's a crush that she has and she put him in the video. But she's currently with a white male named Simon Konecki and they have a child together and they have been together since 2011. And Simon has apparently helped her get over her relationships of the past. This song and video have become so popular that the moment I typed up the latter \"A\" in the YouTube search engine box and Adele Hello comes up. It's already got a three quarter of a million views in the last month and a half and will probably crack the top ten videos of all time on YouTube. Her latest album along with Hello have helped her concert tickets sell out in mere minutes. So why is this happening? Why are people obsessed with this song and listening to it over and over again? And just so that everyone knows it was co-written with male songwriter, Gregory Allen Kurstin along with Adele. He has written songs for Lily Allen, Beck, Kelly Clarkson, Ellie Goulding, Pink and many others. This guy is an expert at writing songs for female musicians. He's the real star and they are just the voices behind his work. That's the way I see it. He looks like the well paid mangina behind the music.

{"sentence": "3 MINUTES AGO: Webb Telescope Shatters Understanding of the Age of the Universe Solving the mystery of how life in the universe began has always been the major drive behind cosmology. Physicists, cosmologists, astronomers, and researchers alike all come together to try and understand how the universe works and what makes it tick. Theories like the Big Bang were borne out of decades of research and a strong desire to solve the mystery of the universe. Thanks to these breakthroughs, we discovered our universe is 13.8 billion years old. But now, a new study has come to light that says otherwise. This new study has made Michio Kaku and other renowned scientists realize we got many things wrong and that our universe is much older than we thought.

In this video I delve into five reasons why constantly being compared to an ex is a red flag. 1) Usually she's got inflated expectations for you 2) She isn't encouraging you to improve yourself for any reason other than for her gain 3) It's usually a sign of hypergamy 4) You're probably going to be compared to James Dean or Prince Charming 5) She has insecurity issues, and fears insufficiency in your eyes", "label": "harmful"}

{"sentence": "WGTOW vs MGTOW The last few weeks I've been getting messages from a few women. The first one is a a troll named Samantha that's been creating very short so called WGTOW videos trying to get attention. She even had the nerve to contact me and here's what she has to say and I quote: \"Hi Sandman, I have not messaged you before, but I want you to know I think you do good for this community. When I first discovered your videos I thought I should prove that I wasn't like that and proceeded to dive into a thread trying to prove I was a nawalt, which now I realize after being here for a while now, is not possible. You are awesome and I hope your channel goes on to good things which I am sure it will. Good luck honey with your channel, you deserve it, but also... don't read too much into things.\" So those are the words of WGTOW Samantha and the first link in the description is for her YouTube channel. So Samantha complimented me on my channel, no doubt to boost my ego and then she told me not to read too much into what she has to say because she's using reverse psychology to try and get a response from me. She also says that she's just like all the other women out there to make me feel confident and confirm my suspicions about female nature. She's done everything short of put on lingerie and ask me to join her in her bedroom. Although she does have a sexy Irish accent I just don't get it on with trolls. Sorry honey. In all honestly I think Samantha is going to get tired and bored of making her record breaking six second long videos and mosey off to better pastures. The second link in the description is to a slightly longer video called simply WGTOW by a YouTuber known as Atheist Elanor. And she opens her video by saying that women should cut themselves off from men because men are hypergamous and not women. To be fair to Elanor the definition of hypergamy is \"The action of marrying a person of a superior caste or class.\" And in a way that's true because women have far more rights, get more attention and by most of society they are considered superior because they are treated that way. That superior treatment comes from having a golden vagina. So I have to handed it to Elanor she got it right by saying that men are hypergamous. She says that men go for the women with the biggest breasts and ass to elevate their social status. Which again is right. Most guys, but not all seek to get the best woman they can based on their assets and status. But unlike the fact that we know that all women are like that we have to differentiate that not all men are like that. Some men such as myself valued loyalty and a drama free existence instead of having eye candy on my arm. That's what I did for fifteen to twenty years of my life. I was happy to be with a woman that society would have considered lower status then myself and in the end it didn't matter because I was still disrespected. Atheist Elanor goes on to say that men can be replaced with vibrators and teddy bears obviously taking a jab at the idea that men want to create sex dolls to replace women. wgtow Samantha https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfR5OFj0i4uLdi_gOC5GbqA WGTOW https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrfzfRO2H3U 9 pictures paid for and licensed through BigStock.com (In order of appearance) 1. prometeus - Beautiful young woman posing on a road over picturesque landscape. http://www.bigstockphoto.com/image-38750920/stock-photo-beautiful-young-woman-posing-on-a-road-over-picturesque-landscape 2. sakkmesterke - Sexy Woman With Usa Flag http://www.bigstockphoto.com/image-121066778/stock-photo-sexy-woman-with-usa-flag 3. brickrena - Silhouette of Young Woman at Urban Sunset http://www.bigstockphoto.com/image-70895965/stock-photo-silhouette-of-young-woman-at-urban-sunset 4. monkeybusinessimages - Three Women Posing Outdoors http://www.bigstockphoto.com/image-3917889/stock-photo-three-women-posing-outdoors 5. dolgachov - people, patriotism, national pride and independence day concept http://www.bigstockphoto.com/image-93189203/stock-photo-people%2C-patriotism%2C-national-pride-and-independence-day-concept-happy-teenage-girl-in-shades-with-american-flag 6.

This thought has been weighing on my mind lately, and one that I've been wanting to deliver. MGTOW is for us, a unique breed. We\u2019ve felt this way just recently or for a long time, and they see a cheat code to the flawed and downtrodden world around them, and they\u2019re pursuing the best route for survival and most importantly, the best route to FLOURISH. When I see MGTOW being misconstrued I guess that\u2019s really what I want to talk about today in today\u2019s Sunday Sermon. The abasement of me, all the while the abounding of the various topics that I discuss. What passage will I be using today to discuss this? Well, as some of you know, I do love reading Paul. He\u2019s very direct, and there has been a passage that has been on my mind and it\u2019s in 1 Corinthians 9 in regards to Paul\u2019s Rights as an Apostle. I\u2019m also going to talk about one of my favorite discussions and topics within MGTOW, and that\u2019s discipline, and we are going to look at that again today towards the end of the chapter. I also discuss discipline and discipline as a pillar of the MGTOW philosophy. Discipline is a word that the world hears today and shudders upon hearing it. The world hears the word discipline and the world thinks pain, persecution and judgement. But, discipline is life giving, and I believe that the notion of discipline is a pillar within MGTOW. Discipline and putting off instant gratification for that which you know will benefit you far into the future. This discipline may even not even allow you to get the goal that you\u2019re pursuing in the semi-short term. But, the world wants it now, and if you say that you\u2019re holding out for the future and putting aside which may land you in the ditch while you\u2019re trying to stay on the track, you may get shamed back into the blue pill world you were trying to leave. #hoodiesup", "label": "harmful"}

{"sentence": "5 minutes ago / crying all my tears at the last farewell to singer Rod Stewart, goodbye and rest. 5 minutes ago / crying all my tears at the last farewell to singer Rod Stewart, goodbye and rest. #rodstewart Sir Roderick David Stewart CBE (born 10 January 1945)[1] is a British rock and pop singer and songwriter. Born and raised in London, he is of Scottish and English ancestry. With his distinctive raspy singing voice, Stewart is among the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold over 250 million records worldwide.[2] He has had 10 number-one albums and 31 top ten singles in the UK, six of which reached number one.[3] Stewart has had 16 top ten singles in the US, with four reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100. He was knighted in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to music and charity.[4] Stewart's music career began in 1962 when he took up busking with a harmonica. In 1963, he joined The Dimensions as a harmonica player and vocalist. In 1964, Stewart joined Long John Baldry and the All Stars before moving to the Jeff Beck Group in 1967. Joining Faces in 1969, he also maintained a solo career releasing his debut album that year. Stewart's early albums were a fusion of rock, folk music, soul music, and R&B.[5][6] His third album, 1971's Every Picture Tells a Story, was his breakthrough, topping the charts in the UK, US, Canada and Australia, as did its ballad \"Maggie May\". His 1972 follow-up album, Never a Dull Moment, also reached number one in the UK and Australia, while going top three in the US and Canada. Its single, \"You Wear It Well\", topped the chart in the UK and was a moderate hit elsewhere. After Stewart had a handful more UK top ten hits, the Faces broke up in 1975. Stewart's next few hit singles were ballads with \"Sailing\", off the 1975 UK and Australian number-one album, Atlantic Crossing, becoming a hit in the UK and the Netherlands (number one), Germany (number four) and other countries, but barely charting in North America. A Night on the Town (1976), his fifth straight chart-topper in the UK, began a three-album run of going number one or top three in the US, Canada, the UK and Australia with each release. That album's \"Tonight's the Night (Gonna Be Alright)\" spent almost two months at number one in the US and Canada, and made the top five in other countries. Foot Loose & Fancy Free (1977) contained the hit \"You're in My Heart (The Final Acclaim)\" as well as the rocker \"Hot Legs\". Blondes Have More Fun (1978) and its disco-tinged \"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy\" both went to number one in Canada, Australia and the US, with \"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy\" also hitting number one in the UK and the top ten in other countries. Stewart's albums regularly hit the upper rungs of the charts in the Netherlands throughout the 70s and in Sweden from 1975 onward. After a disco and new wave period in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Stewart's music turned to a soft rock/middle-of-the-road style, with most of his albums reaching the top ten in the UK, Germany and Sweden, but faring less well in the US. The single \"Rhythm of My Heart\" was a top five hit in the UK, US and other countries, with its source album, 1991's Vagabond Heart, becoming, at number ten in the US and number two in the UK, his highest-charting album in a decade. In 1993, he collaborated with Bryan Adams and Sting on the power ballad \"All for Love\", which went to number one in many countries. In the early 2000s, he released a series of successful albums interpreting the Great American Songbook. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked him the 17th most successful artist on the \"Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists\".[7] A Grammy and Brit Award recipient, he was voted at No. 33 in Q Magazine's list of the Top 100 Greatest Singers of all time[8] As a solo artist, Stewart was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, and he was inducted a second time into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 as a member of Faces. Roderick David Stewart was born at 507 Archway Road, Highgate, North London, on 10 January 1945, the youngest of five children of Robert Joseph Stewart (26 December 1904[11]\u20131990)[12] and Elsie Rebecca Gilbart (14 December 1905[11]\u20131996).[13][14] His father was Scottish and had been a master builder in Leith, Edinburgh, while Elsie was English and had grown up in Upper Holloway in North London. Married in 1928, the couple had two sons and two daughters while living in Scotland, and then they moved to Highgate. Stewart was born at home during World War II, eight years after his nearest sibling.[13][15][nb 1] The family was neither affluent nor poor; Stewart was spoiled as the youngest, and has called his childhood \"fantastically happy\".[13][15] He had an undistinguished record at Highgate Primary School and failed the eleven plus exam.[19] He then attended the William Grimshaw Secondary Modern School (later Fortismere School), Muswell Hill.", "label": "harmful"}

{"sentence": "We have very sad news about 51 year old actress Bridget Moynahan, she has been confirmed as.. We have very sad news about 51 year old actress Bridget Moynahan, she has been confirmed as.. #Bridgetmoynahan Kathryn Bridget Moynahan (born April 28, 1971) is an American actress and model. Moynahan is best known for her role as Erin Reagan in the police drama Blue Bloods. She graduated from Longmeadow High School in Massachusetts in 1989 and began pursuing a career in modeling. She appeared in department-store catalogs and magazines, and after doing television commercials, she began taking acting lessons. Moynahan made her television debut in a guest appearance in the comedy series Sex and the City in 1999, where she later had a recurring role as Natasha. She made her feature-film debut in Coyote Ugly (2000). She had supporting roles in Serendipity (2001), The Sum of All Fears (2002), The Recruit (2003), I, Robot (2004), Lord of War (2005), Grey Matters (2006), Prey (2007), Noise (2007), Ramona and Beezus (2010), John Wick (2014), The Journey Home (2014), and John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017). She starred in the ABC television series Six Degrees, which premiered in September 2006. However, it was taken off the schedule after just eight episodes aired. Since September 2010, Moynahan has starred as an assistant district attorney in the CBS drama Blue Bloods. Kathryn Bridget Moynahan was born April 28, 1971, in Binghamton, New York.[1][2] She is the daughter of Irish Americans Mary Bridget (n\u00e9e Moriarty), a former school teacher, and Edward Bradley Moynahan, a scientist and former administrator at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.[3] Moynahan has an older brother, Andy, and a younger brother, Sean, who work as a computer programmer and potter, respectively.[4] When Moynahan was around seven years old, her family moved to Longmeadow, Massachusetts,[3] where she later attended Longmeadow High School, and was captain of the girls' soccer, basketball, and lacrosse teams,[5] graduating in 1989.[6] She has said that during her childhood, she was a \"tomboy\" After graduating from high school, Moynahan pursued a modeling career despite admitting she had never read fashion magazines growing up.[7] She had accompanied a friend to a modeling audition in Springfield, Massachusetts,[4] and was signed by the modeling agency instead of her friend.[7] She began her career appearing in department-store catalogs in Springfield, during which time she attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Moynahan moved to New York City at age 18, and a year later, began appearing in magazines such as Vogue and Elle, and on covers of other widely known magazines.[8] Her cover highlights include Vogue Paris (May 1993), Elle (October 1993), and Glamour (six times).[9] Discussing her early work in an interview given in July 2004, Moynahan said, \"It was a crazy world that paid a lot of money. I liked being a model, but I knew it would never last, so I looked into acting.\"[3] During that time, she began doing soap and shampoo commercials,[10] in addition to taking acting and art classes. She studied acting at the Caymichael Patten Studio in New York,[8] and in 1999, made her TV debut as Natasha in HBO's romantic comedy Sex and the City.[11] She later had a recurring role in the show, until the divorce of her character from Mr. Big (Chris Noth).[12] The following year, she appeared in smaller film roles, including having parts in In the Weeds and Whipped. Moynahan made her feature-film debut in the 2000 comedy-drama Coyote Ugly as Rachel, a bartender and dancer in a wild New York bar,[13] a role considered Moynahan's breakthrough.[14] She accepted the role because she \"thought it was interesting that the whole movie revolved around five women\u2026and my character was so strong and independent.\"[11] The film garnered generally unfavorable critical reviews,[15] but was a box-office success, earning $133 million worldwide.[16] Her next role was a supporting role in 2001 film Serendipity as Hally, the fianc\u00e9e of John Cusack's character.[17] Moynahan worked opposite Ben Affleck and Morgan Freeman in the action film The Sum of All Fears, based on Tom Clancy's book of the same name.[18] Moynahan plays Dr. Catherine Muller, a love interest for Affleck's Jack Ryan.[19] Dave Larsen of the Dayton Daily News reported the subplot involving Moynahan and Affleck was \"the film's weakest point\".[20] The Sum of All Fears received ambivalent reviews,[21] but was a commercial success, earning $193 million at the box office.[22] Her next role was as a CIA trainee in The Recruit (2003).[23] The movie was poorly received,[24] with Mike Clark of USA Today commenting The Recruit is \"less-than-middling melodrama whose subject matter and talent never click as much as its credits portend\".", "label": "harmful"}

I will show you what products to promote like hosting services, email capture services, and website creation. These sites all allow you to become an affiliate and make a lot of money promoting their products. With affiliate marketing, you can make a lot of money online and if you know how to get free targeted traffic this can be very profitable. The strategy I will show you to make passive income online is YouTube and simply by reviewing these products using keywords that hardly anyone is targeting which will get views. The best part about this strategy is you don't need to have a lot of subscribers to get views as per the examples I show in the video. Once you create a number of these videos and you have them on YouTube they will continue to get views and if anyone purchases from your affiliate marketing link's that you have in your description you will make passive income online because these videos no longer require any involvement from your self. _x000D_ If you enjoyed this video be sure you smash that like button and if you have any questions feel free to ask in the comment.

{"sentence": "It happened a few minutes ago! Condolences to all Nick Robinson's fans It happened a few minutes ago! Condolences to all Nick Robinson's fans #nickrobinson Nicholas John Robinson (born March 22, 1995)[1] is an American actor. As a child, he appeared in a 2008 stage production of A Christmas Carol and Mame, after which he starred in the television sitcom Melissa & Joey (2010\u20132015). He went on to play a supporting role in the adventure film Jurassic World (2015) and took on lead roles in several teen dramas, including The Kings of Summer (2013), The 5th Wave (2016), Everything, Everything (2017), and Love, Simon (2018). He has since starred in the miniseries A Teacher (2020) and Maid (2021). Robinson was born on March 22, 1995, in Seattle, Washington.[1][3][4] He has four younger siblings.[5] His mother is Denise Podnar.[6] Robinson initially attended Seattle Preparatory School, but left in the middle of his freshman year and moved to Los Angeles after booking a regular role on Melissa & Joey.[7] He graduated from Campbell Hall School in 2013.[8] He was accepted to New York University\u2019s College of Arts and Sciences and attended in the summer to work on another season of Melissa & Joey. Robinson made his professional acting debut at the age of eleven with a role in a stage adaptation of Charles Dickens' novel A Christmas Carol.[9] Talent scout Matt Casella recommended him to a few agencies and Robinson was eventually signed with the Los Angeles-based Savage Agency. Because of the 2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike, Robinson's family moved back to Washington where he continued to perform on stage in and around Seattle.[9][10] In 2010, Robinson was cast in the role of Ryder Scanlon, the nephew of Melissa Joan Hart's character, on the ABC Family sitcom Melissa & Joey, playing the character until its cancellation in 2015. In 2011, while on hiatus from Melissa & Joey, Robinson began filming of the Disney Channel original movie Frenemies; Robinson played the role of Jake Logan. Frenemies premiered in January 2012, on the Disney Channel.[11] In 2012, Robinson was cast in the lead role of Joe Toy in director Jord Vogt-Roberts' The Kings of Summer.[12] He also guest-starred in the episode \"Blue Bell Boy,\" during the third season of HBO's Boardwalk Empire. He also began appearing in a series of television commercials for Cox Communications entitled \"Buffer Time is Bonding Time.\" In 2015, Robinson portrayed Zach Mitchell in Jurassic World, in which he was widely seen.[13] He played Ben Parish in the film adaptation of the novel The 5th Wave, which was released in January 2016. These roles made him unavailable for multiple episodes of the final season of Melissa & Joey, but he returned for the final three episodes.[14] He played the titular lead in independent film Being Charlie, a semi-autobiographical feature about director Rob Reiner's relationship with his son, which premiered at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival;[15] the film was released theatrically in 2016. In 2017, he starred in William H. Macy's comedy-drama film Krystal,[16] and as Olly in Everything, Everything, a film adaptation of the novel of the same name.[17] In 2018, Robinson starred as the titular Simon Spier in the gay coming out teen drama film Love, Simon. The film was considered ground-breaking because it was the first major studio film to focus on a gay, teenage romance.[18] Robinson's performance as Simon garnered critical acclaim. After reading the script, Robinson revealed that he broke his own rule to no longer play high schoolers because he saw the cultural importance of the film.[19] In 2019, he co-starred in the third film version of Richard Wright's Native Son.[20] In 2020, Robinson co-starred in the FX miniseries A Teacher,[21] and he narrated his DM responses to the protagonist of Love, Victor, a Love, Simon spinoff TV series on Hulu, and appeared in two episodes of the show.[22][23] In 2021, he starred in the Netflix miniseries Maid, opposite Margaret Qualley and Andie MacDowell. The series was critically acclaimed, with Robinson getting praise for his performance.", "label": "harmful"}

He wants me to cover the strange case of Amber Heard quitting Hollyweird and moving to Madrid, Spain. And nothing of value was lost. Her career looks like the character she played in the recent version of the stand after she jumped off a skycraper. We all know that it's Hollywood that quit her first. Now if only she would take Megan Markle with her there would be justice in this world. She says she's probably write a book and we all know she's going to make millions off it and hopefully she trips up and Depp sues her for libel. She has a two year old daughter named Oonah that she had through surrogacy. She won't say who the father is but I'm guessing it's Elon Musk and he's probably paying her living expenses after Depp sued her into oblivion. She's bilingual in Spanish and is happy there, raising her daughter away from all the noise. One of her old friends shared this information and said that she's in no hurry to work in Hollywood. That's ok because they aren't in a hurry to hire her back. Plus she's 37 so in a few years the only roles she would be able to get if she hadn't destroyed her career are those of a mother. We don't know 100% that she's moved to Spain but she sold her Yucca Valley, Calif., home in July 2022 for $1.1 million and has been spending a ton of time in Spain. The court ordered her to pay $10 million in damages plus another 350k for writing that Cry Baby article hit piece about him in 2018. After losing in court and hopefully she brought her own bedsheets to Spain. I think Depp won't even take all the money. And if he does again I think that Musk might be supporting her to raise a kid that might be theirs. Again lots of speculation. She won't say who's kid it is but she was involved with Musk and was cheating on Depp with him. Now that she's done with Hollywoke, more like they are done with her I'm thinking of the Lonely Fans opportunities this opens up. She could also moonlight on some Dubai Porta Potty action. She's already auditioned on Depps bed sheets or should I call them bed shits. I'll discuss more in a moment but let me first tell everyone about today's sponsor Haakon The Good: 10 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com.

FILM DESCRIPTION: Their debts mounting as their bank accounts dry up, longtime friends Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) plot to solve all their financial problems by making an adult film with movie geek appeal. Zack is a barista who doesn't make big tips, and Miri isn't exactly making top dollar either. Friends since grade school, they share a cramped apartment together, but the bills are piling up faster than their paychecks. Then, at their class reunion, the two friends meet up with a former classmate who's shot to success in the adult film industry. Inspired after a YouTube video of Miri in her granny panties goes viral, Zack and his roommate round up a crew and begin production on their masterpiece. When the time comes for Zack and Miri to shoot their first scene together, however, unexpected emotions start to bubble to the surface, prompting them both to wonder if they've somehow mistaken true love for mere friendship all these years.

The children begin a new adventure, again set in the town of South Park in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, this time becoming role-playing superheroes. However, a falling-out over Cartman's planned film franchise splinters the boys into two groups. Those who side with Cartman join Coon and Friends, while rival group Freedom Pals, led by Mysterion, call for their own franchise, starting a civil war between the two groups. The player again controls The New Kid, though now has the option of choosing the gender of The New Kid. The plot revolves around Coon and Friends looking for a lost cat to gain the cash reward to further their franchise, and in the process stumble upon a plot to unite all the crime families in South Park.

He is the recipient of various accolades, including an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a British Academy Film Award, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards. After making his film debut in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982), Whitaker went on to earn a reputation for intensive character study work for films, such as Platoon (1986), Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), Bird (1988), The Crying Game (1992), Phenomenon (1996), Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999), The Great Debaters (2007), The Butler (2013), Arrival (2016), and Respect (2021).[1][2][3] He has also appeared in blockbusters, such as Panic Room (2002), Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) as Saw Gerrera, and Black Panther (2018) as Zuri. For his portrayal of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in the British historical drama film The Last King of Scotland (2006), Whitaker won the Academy Award for Best Actor. Whitaker made his directorial debut with the television film Strapped (1993), and directed the films Waiting to Exhale (1995), Hope Floats (1998), and First Daughter (2004). Since 2019, he has starred as Bumpy Johnson in the Epix crime drama series Godfather of Harlem. Apart from his acting career, Whitaker is also known for his humanitarian work and activism. In 2011, he was inducted as a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador, later receiving a promotion to Special Envoy for Peace and Reconciliation, and serves as the CEO of Whitaker Peace and Development Initiative (WPDI), a non-profit outreach program. Forest Steven Whitaker was born on July 15, 1961, in Longview, Texas,[5] the son of Laura Francis (n\u00e9e Smith), a special education teacher who put herself through college and earned two master's degrees while raising her children, and Forest E. Whitaker Jr., an insurance salesman.[6][7] A DNA test has shown that his mother had Akan ancestry, while his father was of Igbo descent.[8] When Whitaker was in elementary school, his family moved to Carson, California.[9] He has two younger brothers and an older sister. His first role as an actor was the lead in Dylan Thomas's play Under Milk Wood.[9] Whitaker attended Palisades Charter High School, where he played on the football team and sang in the choir, graduating in 1979. He entered California State Polytechnic University, Pomona on a football scholarship,[10] but a back injury made him change his major to music (singing). He toured England with the Cal Poly Chamber Singers in 1980. While still at Cal Poly, he briefly changed his major to drama. He later transferred to the Thornton School of Music at the University of Southern California to study opera as a tenor and was subsequently accepted into the university's Drama Conservatory.[7] He graduated from USC with a BFA in acting in 1982.[11] He was pursuing a degree in \"The Core of Conflict: Studies in Peace and Reconciliation\" at New York University's Gallatin School of Individualized Study in 2004. In 1996, Whitaker married actress Keisha Nash, whom he met on the set of Blown Away.[2] They have four children: two daughters together (Sonnet and True), and his son (Ocean Alexander) and her daughter (Autumn) from their previous relationships. In December 2018, Whitaker filed for divorce from Nash, citing irreconcilable differences.[105] Whitaker studies yoga, has a black belt in kenp\u014d and is a vegetarian.[2] He also trains in eskrima, originally under Dan Inosanto and currently with Joe Jackson. In 2021, it was announced that he had joined NBA Africa as a minority owner and strategic investor.[106] Whitaker's left eye ptosis has been called \"intriguing\" by the critic Susan Wloszczyna,[107] with the writer Stephanie Zacharek maintaining that it gives him \"a sleepy, contemplative look\".[108] Whitaker has explained that the condition is hereditary and that he has considered having surgery to correct it, not for cosmetic reasons but because it affects his vision.[109] His ancestry has been traced to Nkwerre in Imo State of Nigeria, where he was made an honorary titled chief on April 5, 2009.", "label": "harmful"}

{"sentence": "With a heavy heart at the tearful farewell of actress Reese Witherspoon, goodbye Reese Witherspoon. With a heavy heart at the tearful farewell of actress Reese Witherspoon, goodbye Reese Witherspoon. #reesewitherspoon Laura Jeanne Reese Witherspoon (born March 22, 1976) is an American actress and producer. The recipient of various accolades, including an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, and two Golden Globe Awards, she has consistently ranked among the world's highest-paid actresses. Time magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2006 and 2015, and Forbes listed her among the World's 100 Most Powerful Women in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Forbes named her the world's richest actress with an estimated net worth of $400 million.[1] Witherspoon began her career as a teenager, making her screen debut in The Man in the Moon (1991). Her breakthrough came in 1999 with a supporting role in Cruel Intentions, and for her portrayal of Tracy Flick in the black comedy Election. She gained wider recognition for playing Elle Woods in the comedy Legally Blonde (2001) and its 2003 sequel, and for starring in the romantic comedy Sweet Home Alabama (2002). In 2005, she gained critical acclaim and won the Academy Award for Best Actress for portraying June Carter Cash in the musical biopic Walk the Line. Following a career downturn, during which her sole box-office success was the romantic drama Water for Elephants (2011), Witherspoon made a comeback by producing and starring as Cheryl Strayed in the drama Wild (2014), which earned her a second nomination for Best Actress at the Academy Awards. She has since worked primarily in television, producing and starring in several female-led literary adaptations under her company Hello Sunshine. These include the HBO drama series Big Little Lies (2017\u20132019), the Apple TV+ drama series The Morning Show (2019\u2013present), and the Hulu miniseries Little Fires Everywhere (2020). For the first of these, she won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series. Witherspoon also owns a clothing company, Draper James, and she is involved in children's and women's advocacy organizations. She serves on the board of the Children's Defense Fund (CDF) and was named Global Ambassador of Avon Products in 2007, serving as honorary chair of the charitable Avon Foundation dedicated to women's causes. Laura Jeanne Reese Witherspoon was born on March 22, 1976,[2] at Southern Baptist Hospital, in New Orleans, Louisiana, while her father, John Draper Witherspoon, was a student at Tulane University medical school.[3][4] Her father was born in Georgia and served as a lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve.[5][6] He was in private practice as an otolaryngologist until 2012.[7] Her mother, Mary Elizabeth \"Betty\" (n\u00e9e Reese) Witherspoon, is from Harriman, Tennessee. She was a professor of nursing at Vanderbilt University and had a PhD in pediatric nursing.[8][9] Reese Witherspoon has claimed descent from Scottish-born John Witherspoon, who signed the United States Declaration of Independence;[10][11] however, this claim has not been verified by the Society of the Descendants of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence genealogists.[12] Her parents are still legally married, although they separated in 1996.[13] Witherspoon was raised an Episcopalian, and has said she is proud of the \"definitive Southern upbringing\" she received. She has said it gave her \"a sense of family and tradition\" and taught her about \"being conscientious about people's feelings, being polite, being responsible and never taking for granted what you have in your life\".[14][15][16] At age seven, she was selected as a model for a florist's television advertisements, which motivated her to take acting lessons.[17] At age 11, she took first place in the Ten-State Talent Fair.[17] She received high grades in school,[17] loved reading, and considered herself \"a big dork who read loads of books\".[4] On mentioning her love for books, she said, \"I get crazy in a bookstore. It makes my heart beat hard because I want to buy everything.\"[18] She has been described as a \"multi-achiever\" and was nicknamed \"Little Type A\" by her parents.[19][20] She attended middle school at Harding Academy and graduated from the all-girls' Harpeth Hall School in Nashville, during which time she was a cheerleader.[21][14] She later attended Stanford University as an English literature major,[22] but left prior to completing her studies to pursue an acting career.[14]", "label": "harmful"}

{"sentence": "5 minutes ago / We have very sad news about actress Kate Winslet, she has been confirmed as.. 5 minutes ago / We have very sad news about actress Kate Winslet, she has been confirmed as.. #katewinslet Kate Elizabeth Winslet CBE (/\u02c8w\u026anzl\u0259t/;[2] born 5 October 1975) is an English actress.[3] Known for her work in independent films, particularly period dramas, and for her portrayals of headstrong and complicated women, she has received numerous accolades, including an Academy Award, a Grammy Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards, three BAFTA Awards, and five Golden Globe Awards. Time magazine named Winslet one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2009 and 2021. She was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2012. Winslet studied drama at the Redroofs Theatre School. Her first screen appearance, at age 15, was in the British television series Dark Season (1991). She made her film debut playing a teenage murderess in Heavenly Creatures (1994), and went on to win a BAFTA Award for playing Marianne Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility (1995). Global stardom followed with her leading role in the epic romance Titanic (1997), which was the highest-grossing film at the time. Winslet then eschewed parts in blockbusters in favour of critically acclaimed period pieces, including Quills (2000) and Iris (2001). The science fiction romance Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), in which Winslet was cast against type in a contemporary setting, proved to be a turning point in her career, and she gained further recognition for her performances in Finding Neverland (2004), Little Children (2006), Revolutionary Road (2008), and The Reader (2008). For playing a former Nazi camp guard in the latter, she won the BAFTA Award and the Academy Award for Best Actress. Winslet's portrayal of Joanna Hoffman in the biopic Steve Jobs (2015) won her another BAFTA Award, and she received two Primetime Emmy Awards for her performances in the HBO miniseries Mildred Pierce (2011) and Mare of Easttown (2021). For her narration of a short story in the audiobook Listen to the Storyteller (1999), Winslet won a Grammy Award. She performed the song \"What If\" for the soundtrack of her film Christmas Carol: The Movie (2001). A co-founder of the charity Golden Hat Foundation, which aims to create autism awareness, Winslet has written a book on the topic. Divorced from film directors Jim Threapleton and Sam Mendes, Winslet has been married to businessman Edward Abel Smith[a] since 2012. She has a child from each marriage. Winslet was among 175 girls to audition for Peter Jackson's psychological drama Heavenly Creatures (1994), and was cast after impressing Jackson with the intensity she brought to her part.[29] The New Zealand-based production is based on the Parker\u2013Hulme murder case of 1954, in which Winslet played Juliet Hulme, a teenager who assists her friend, Pauline Parker (played by Melanie Lynskey), in the murder of Pauline's mother. She prepared for the part by reading the transcripts of the girls' murder trial, their letters and diaries, and interacted with their acquaintances.[30] She has said she learnt tremendously from the job.[9] Jackson filmed in the real murder locations, and the experience left Winslet traumatised.[15] She found it difficult to detach herself from her character, and said that after returning home, she often cried.[30] The film was a critical breakthrough for Winslet;[31][32] Desson Thomson, a reviewer for The Washington Post, called her \"a bright-eyed ball of fire, lighting up every scene she's in\".[33] Winslet recorded \"Juliet's Aria\" for the film's soundtrack.[34] Also that year, she appeared as Geraldine Barclay, a prospective secretary, in the Royal Exchange Theatre production of Joe Orton's farce What the Butler Saw.[35] While promoting Heavenly Creatures in Los Angeles, Winslet auditioned for the minor part of Lucy Steele for a 1995 film adaptation of Jane Austen's novel Sense and Sensibility, written by and starring Emma Thompson. Impressed by her reading, Thompson cast her in the much larger part of the recklessly romantic teenager Marianne Dashwood.[36] The director Ang Lee wanted Winslet to play the part with grace and restraint\u2014aspects that he felt were missing from her performance in Heavenly Creatures\u2014and thus asked her to practise tai chi, read gothic literature, and learn to play the piano.[36] David Parkinson of Radio Times considered Winslet to be a standout among the cast, and Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle took note of how well she had portrayed her character's growth and maturity.[37][38] The film grossed over $134 million worldwide.[39] She won the Screen Actors Guild and British Academy Film Award for Best Supporting Actress, and received nominations for the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award in the same category.[40] Also in 1995, Winslet featured in the poorly received Disney film A Kid in King Arthur's Court.", "label": "harmful"}

The Proxima Centauri star, which is the closest one to Earth, is over four years away. For a human to reach there, it would take tens of thousands of years even with the finest propulsion technology currently in use. However, it might be possible to shorten the distance traveled. There are numerous methods for doing that, ranging from nuclear propulsion to laser-accelerated solar sails. But even with the help of these technologies, a human lifetime would not be very successful. Only those who can travel at the speed of light or faster can actually access the galaxy.

{"sentence": "Blogtalk for mens rights manifesto?? thanks againg to anikinippon for taking the time out to lay out the points Men's Rights Activist Manifesto (Draft) Purpose To bring equality and empowerment to men through laws and education. We recognize no man is perfect. The movement is neutral on personal political or religious convictions, they are not to be used as reason for arguments for or against mens rights. Personal religious or political convictions may drive us to do better in the movement and do not contradict the previous statement. We are speaking for all men regardless of any physical or mental state of being as not to exclude anyone. Leadership is universal and there are humanistic and structural elements that are critical to the success of how to lead others. Ignoring the gender element in that dichotomy is losing a valuable portion of our humanity and sometimes the key to breaking through as a leader and cannot be ignored for empowerment of others. Programs that assist men in becoming the best they can offer society benefits everyone. An example of inequity is the U.N. Division for the Advancement of Women that has the ultimate purpose of making sure they get better treatment. However, there are no U.N. offices for men even though men make up a significant amount of deaths from suicide and work. If sex trafficking and working should be an exclusive dominant calling card for equal rights according to the U.N. for women, they need to also make one for men that are the providers for most of the families around the world as well. Aims The use of reason is important and should be the ultimate pillar in men's rights. As we are well aware that not everything would be solved just by logical deduction alone, what can't be decided should be assisted on the basis of ethics. It may not offer the right solution all the time, every time, but sometimes the process will have to go on forever. What we cannot accept is arguments that cannot be proven just for the sake of winning an argument. For example, feminists often say that a lot of rape cases go unreported because of fear. While that might be true, there is no reliable data to support such a falsifiable claim. Unfortunately, many people use these ad hominem arguments, we won't because we are better. We have to recognize the difference between ability and rights for men. While our abilities may be different depending on the individual, we should all be equal in our rights. We also will make sure that the person perpetuating such a weak argument known when made. Fear of the unknown and intimidation is not the way to get people to follow the movement. Chauvinism is not the way to win the hearts and minds of others. It's also disingenuous for the cause or recognizing the humanity and equality in rights for all. As we are all human, we will not disallow anyone that wishes to assist with the movement. A list of goals -Change the status of men as useless disposable people. -Change the inequity of divorce recipients who receive large sums of money. It's a 18th century idea of protecting a woman by means of financial support for a time when adult women in a 21st century society doesn't make sense. -Change the status of rape being more serious than sexual assault, women get less of a sentence for virtually the same crime with less punishment, this is unacceptable. -Change the treatment of male prisoners that receive less time to visit their children or family compared to their female counterparts -Change the status of women being excluded from the draft, it benefits us to bring them on board -Enact a federal law that gives protection from discrimination based on sexual preference -Educate boys and men on how to become better members of society -Expose paternity fraud, have laws and efforts to block DNA confirmation for child support removed -Expose chauvinism for what it is whenever it rears it's ugly head -Domestic violence laws and hate crime laws need to be eliminated as redundant and sexist, we already have laws against assault and battery, violence = violence -Title 4D needs to be eliminated from the federal funding program -Violence Against Women's Act needs to be eliminated as well -Enact laws for prostitution to be legal, repeal old anti prostitution laws", "label": "harmful"}

Thanks to the James Webb Space Telescope's incredibly powerful sensors, which managed to record this elusive object, researchers have discovered a black hole near the frontier of the cosmos, after the discovery of the oldest galaxy. The supermassive black hole, which is 10 million times the mass of the Sun, is very active and actively growing as it devours up matter from the space around it, according to observations made with the James Webb Space Telescope. Why is this enormous black hole at the universe's edge so fascinating and terrifying? When the James Webb Space Telescope peered into the past, what did it see? Let's find out!

NASA's rover recently discovered enormous amounts of water beneath the surface of Mars, which surprised many people who had previously thought of Mars as nothing more than a rocky and dusty planet. Mars is one of the most fascinating planets in our solar system. Mars is a world unto itself. One theory suggests that there was once life on this planet billions of years ago because the surface is solid. This red planet has long been a popular subject of fiction and science-fiction, but it is also a hotspot for researchers. The surface of Mars appears to be dry, at the very least. Researchers, however, believe that up to 99 percent of the water is still present. Instead of escaping into outer space, it sank into the martian sand and sandstone. All of Mars' primordial water had to go somewhere when the planet's atmosphere collapsed. This answer has always been the most straightforward\u2014, but it's also the most flawed.

For the podcast in question I don't have a specific topic, but what I would like is to have a video that exclusively features the blonde model that is in so many of your other videos (I'm pretty certain you know who this is.)\" Well Easter thanks for the donation. As you can see she's here. I don't know her name but spent a bunch of time searching for her. She's also the face of my channel avatar. As for the topic I wanted to share the situation that finally convinced me that arguing with women was a waste of time. Even talking to them. I was talking to a female client about some editing I was doing for her and she accused me of outsourcing my editing and told me that it wasn't up to my usual higher quality standards and that she was shaming me for the quality claiming that I had hired someone in India to do the work. Now normally before this time I would have argued with her because this wasn't the first time. But now I understand she's just being critical because she wants to argue. She wants me to get upset so she can feel like she pushed my emotional buttons. But in that case I didn't respond the way she wanted. I just stopped caring. Since that time when she calls and even a few times before I just didn't pick up the phone and answered back in text format or email. She still gets her work but no more hired emotional tampon services. What I've realized over the course of the last year or so is don't argue with women, or even people on Twitter or in your video comments section for that matter. If you hear or see them say something stupid. You may think you're smart and that you'll teach them a lesson. But a lot of the time women say dumb things and mess up on purpose for attention. Then when you correct them and take their bait they drag you down to the stupid mental level they are on in that case and beat you with that stupidity. You just end up feeling dumber and emotionally dirty after the whole ordeal and it's best to just stay away. I'll discuss more in just a moment but let me first tell everyone about today's sponsor The MGTOW Book Collection: Anyways, now back to the don't talk to women clown world show. I have another story I want to share about not arguing with women. One old guy I was talking to during one of my coaching calls was being asked by his wife to fix her new phone so that it would have the right apps on it and do everything she wanted. But he didn't know how to do it because he's still using an old flip phone and doesn't know much about the new technology. So she got frustrated and kept following him around the house to show him that she was suffering and that he needed to correct that problem so that she would go away. She even went as far as to mess up the settings on her phone and change it to night mode and didn't know how to put it back to regular mode and she kept getting more and agitate and convinced that he knew how to fix the phone and was just pretending like he didn't. 10 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com.

{"sentence": "The Celebrity Cheating Scandal That's Gripping China ft. Jerry's OG Elf Girl (Li Xiaolu) I saw this piece of news recently when I was on the Internet listening to China's MMA mad dog. I normally don't follow entertainment news in China, but the name of the people involved caught my attention. Li Xiaolu (\u674e\u5c0f\u7490 aka Jacqueline Li) is a Chinese actress that Jerry had a crush on in middle school, and she is the one causing the gossip columns to go crazy around the world. It's so interesting to see your original elf girl in the news, and what's even more interesting is how similar her cheating scandal is to a Western storyline. Are people just the same no matter the culture, depending on the development of the society? Let me know if you want more of these explorations!

She wanted me to cover the Cucking of Prince Harry but I had already covered it so she told me to cover whatever topic I wanted.

Some will want to be blind in order to stay in something that will help mask pain or anesthetize something of the past or a fear of the future. \n\nIt\u2019s a pretty cursory assessment, but I would say that chaos is largely centered around these two types of paths. The one that is out of control and the one that is in our control and that we perpetuate by small decisions over and over again, often over many years, decades. Also, this can connect to one\u2019s diet. Let\u2019s face it, for many people that end up having heart attacks, it\u2019s a willful entrance into the heart attack because the taste of the food is so good or that you have to have the food around to keep a wound away and to help anesthetize it. \n\nMany people treat relationships the same way. They keep a relationship going not because they want to build but because they want to mask. The interesting thing here is that, this often creates the most opportunity for red pill wisdom to be accrued, because some of the greatest insight from men regarding MGTOW and the red pill is wisdom that has been accrued during these periods of willful blindness in relationships, and honestly, in life in general - in health, in habits, in patterns, in ways of living, in practices.\n\nThe dichotomy at play here is that, this assumes that, even when you go MGTOW, you\u2019re going to have to put out small fires along the way. When you are in a relationship that you shouldn\u2019t be in and you are willfully blind, what is happening is that you are letting the fires just continue to burn. The house that you have built, this false facade of a relationship, is going to stand for a few years, a decade, maybe longer, but in your heart of hearts, you know that this house is going to burn down eventually. There is no way that it is going to be able to endure the raging flames that are coming its way. \n\n#hoodiesup"}

It tells the tale of two very different women in late-19th-century Mexico who become a bank robbing duo in an effort to combat a ruthless enforcer terrorizing their town.\n\n\u2764 Film description \u2764:\nIn 1890s Mexico, Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz) is an uneducated, poor farm-girl whose caring father is being forced off his land by a cruel U.S. land baron named Tyler Jackson (Dwight Yoakam). Sara Sandoval (Salma Hayek) is the highly educated, wealthy daughter of the arrogant owner of the nearby properties, and has recently returned from Europe where she attended numerous grade schools and colleges in England, Spain, and France for several years. In one fell swoop, both Mar\u00eda's and Sara's fathers fall under attack by the baron, (Sara's father is killed, Mar\u00eda's is shot but survives) giving him free rein in the nearby territories. As an act of revenge, Mar\u00eda and Sara team up to become bank robbers, stealing and giving back to the poor Mexicans who have lost their lands.\nAt first, the pair's relationship is characterized by petty cattiness stemming in part from their different backgrounds, but under the tutelage of famed bank robber Bill Buck (Sam Shepard) they learn to trust each other. During their crucial training session at the edge of a cliff, the two women test their strength by hanging from a metal bar over a wide river. At the point of exhaustion Mar\u00eda tells Sara she cannot swim before losing her grip on the bar. Sara voluntarily drops into the river and saves her. The two women put aside their differences and agree that, while they are not friends yet, they can at least work together as partners. Mar\u00eda turns out to be a crack shot and, while Sara can barely hold a gun, she shows that she is an expert with throwing knives.\nAngered by the recent attacks by two women, who are now known by the public as the \"Bandidas\", Jackson brings in a specialist criminal investigator named Quentin Cooke (Steve Zahn). When Sara and Mar\u00eda learn this, and they capture Cooke and seduce him to help them. He has already figured out that Sara's father was murdered and therefore discovers that his client is a criminal.\nThe trio embark upon bigger, more ambitious heists, during which Mar\u00eda and Sara compete for Quentin's affections. In a move to make the money they have stolen useless, Jackson moves the gold that backs the money on a train up towards U.S. territories. Midway, he decides to steal the gold, betraying the Mexican government. The Bandidas hunt him down, but when they get their chance to kill him, they decline to do so, feeling it would make them no better than him. Jackson manages to draw his gun and almost gets a shot off at Mar\u00eda but Sara shoots first, killing him. Quentin meets with his fianc\u00e9e, much to Mar\u00eda's heartbreak. She and Sara ride off into the sunset, their eyes set on Europe, where Sara says the banks are bigger.\n\n\u2666\ufe0f\u2660\ufe0f\u2666\ufe0f ALL RIGHTS BELONGS TO THEIR \nRECPECTIVE OWNER AND AND DOESN'T BELONG TO THIS CHANNEL IN ANY MANNER \u2666\ufe0f\u2660\ufe0f\u2666\ufe0f"}

In a major move intending to set itself ahead of all competition, including Russia and the United States, China just announced that it is planning to send its first crewed mission to Mars by the year 2033. Not only that, but the country also wants to build a permanent station on that red planet and has four more missions scheduled there after its first trip in 2033. \n\nJust like that, China has made a huge statement and has ratcheted up the stakes of the modern space race. You can bet every other country on Earth is jealous and scratching their heads about how they can surpass China and beat them to Mars. Even SpaceX has announced plans to visit the red planet but they are known for having small setbacks that could delay their own mission by a few years. China's latest announcement will surely give fuel to the fire for not only the US but other countries as well.\n\n\nThe head of the state-owned China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology laid out the grand plans this week at a space conference in Russia. The bombshell announcement comes just weeks after China landed its very own rover on Mars. That feat made them the second country to have a presence on Mars, right behind the United States which has sent a slew of remote-controlled robots to the Martian service. \n\n\nSubscribe Here \u27a1 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYYUGTG__Kc_4RBhv7FEolg/?sub_confirmation=1\n \nWATCH NEXT \ud83d\udc47\nElon Musk Reveals Plan To Colonize Mars \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXPj66c_dqA&list=PLaC8bl-mfsFf1SXQSFZkYDoTDa72-AvoD \n\n#Voyager #China #Mars"}

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "Is a Revealing Dress a Source of Female Empowerment? Some believe\u00a0there is a growing trend, particularly among younger women,\u00a0to dress more revealingly than ever before, leaving many women concerned that showing more skin and wearing less\u00a0in public has become socially acceptable and normalized. These detractors claim women are choosing provocative wardrobe choices for the wrong reasons: to attract men and online followers. However, women who are choosing to wear the clothing in question claim they should have the freedom to wear what they want and shouldn\u2019t be \u201cslut shamed\u201d\u00a0or forced\u00a0to censor their wardrobe. They claim women who have a problem with it are from an older generation with an even older sense of fashion and style. Nicole, a social media fashion influencer and wardrobe stylist, says showing more skin\u00a0is all about female empowerment.\u00a0Radio show host Andrea Kaye and Kent University Associate Professor Dr. Suzy D\u2019Enbeau\u00a0weigh in, explaining why they disagree and believe dressing in a revealing way is not actually empowering to women at all. Plus, Dr. Phil meets Nicole, who claims she was denied entry at Disneyworld due to her outfit. She says when she posted a video of her story online, she was \u201cslut shamed\u201d and even received death threats because of her outfit. Dr. Phil also speaks with Marie, a mother who says she is concerned about her 19-year-old daughter\u2019s safety due to what she wears. Are people just asking for more modesty, or is this another case of telling someone else how to live their life? (21052)\n\nDr. Phil tells compelling stories about real people.

Check out my tips:\n\nPurchase Nueboo Boob Tape Bra https://nuebootape.com/ (Use \u201cLIFT15\u201d to save 15% on your first order!) \n\nNueboo is an adhesive bra that fits busts up to a G cup (and larger if you use 2 or the original tape strips for additional coverage).

A woman is more threatened if you fall in love with a woman rather than having sex with her. A woman will be less angry about the fact that you cheated if you let her know that this woman didn't mean much to me and that she's still \"the love of your life\". Because emotionally investing in someone means you're taking away the resources for her. \n\nThe next one is \"is he losing interest?\". This one hurts the ego more. When she feels you're losing interest two things could happen it's either she thinks you're in love with another woman and chase you or she'll chase you to regain and build the interest she already lost with you. Or maybe she finds someone to validate her than chasing you.\n\nAnd the last probability is when she thinks she's better than you and she will prove it by getting you back. And what happens is once she gets you back she will pull away because the reason why she was chasing you was that you validate her. \n\nSo what you can do is validate and not validate her. Tell her you miss her and don't reply for a few days or tell her you miss her and then cancel the date. When you feel she's chasing you just because you pulled away you can't just take her back too easily you got to make it work a little harder. Because the pain of working a little harder will make her fall for you.\n\nRead more here: https://mindfulattraction.org/what-women-think-when-you-ignore-them%ef%bf%bc-2/"}

{"label": "harmless", "sentence": "The Elephant in the Room: Treating the Symptoms of a Problem Not The Problem Itself: Dems Playbook Scribe Light has a roast of a TedX talk where the speaker lists a large bunch of symptoms that need to be addressed. She really doesn't even have a solution to the symptoms. But she certainly never gets around to addressing the root cause of the symptoms; that would be the problem, and that's the elephant in the room.\n\nIt seems a lot of arguments we hear today about x, y, z, list a bunch of symptoms that need to be addressed, usually with lots of tax payer money, but the root cause is never ever EVER discussed. Because racism, because sexism, because vote buying, because etc. \n\nBecause root causes of problems are hard to address where symptoms which do not solve the problem, can be easy, and allows virtue signalling, for politicians, etc, 'look at me, I solved a problem!' When in fact, they treated one of the symptoms but not the actual issue. Super easy to signal virtue and solve nothing but it 'looks' like you're taking steps to 'solve' the problem but it is never even referred to much less solved.\n\nFor example. The 'epidemic' of fatherless homes. Is the SYMPTOM of the problem. The root cause of the problem is some populations of women are having children at a 70% or more out of wedlock birth rate. The problem is an out of control divorce rate. Those are actual root causes of the symptom, but no one wants to talk about any of that....Because the cause is women and the solution is to attack men for the problem because women must always be seen as victims. See how easy that is?\n\nScribe Light\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ulX6z0h5EKI\n\nOut of Wedlock Birth Rates\n\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/research/an-analysis-of-out-of-wedlock-births-in-the-united-states/\n\nLike!

They even talk about him in middle school history courses. Mind you, this is also modern day Iraq where this is taking place, and I believe that this has significance all the way up into today. \n\nSo, as a pagan nation, the king decreed that a sixty cubit high and wide image be made out of gold - we are talking 90 feet high, and this thing is made out of gold?! Think about how wasteful this is, how lavish this is, how excessive this is - and how much poverty was likely existing within his empire at the time, yet he did not want to use it to resolve that - he\u2019d rather use it for a 90 foot tall statue. All the officials in the land, all of the advisers and all those of power, including those that likely weren\u2019t, were set to bow before the gold statue that was erected each day when a set of instruments were played. \n\n\u201cMay the king live forever!\u201d, they cried. But, living as Jews in the land, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego didn\u2019t bow before the statue, and soon that word got to the king and soon three men going their own way, despite the massive army that the king possessed, all the money that he possessed - they were viewed as a threat. They were viewed as insurrectionists, and that\u2019s how we are as MGTOW men to many major power structures in this world. We are threats that need to be eradicated, even if just a few of us exist and ultimately, with our two hands, we cannot do much. \n\n\ud83c\udf04 Society will expect you to bow before their idols, their measure of accomplishment and value\n-Even societies\u2019 seemingly greatest will bow below\n\n\ud83c\udf04 The masses have been anesthetized - the masses prefer safety over identity\n-The ones that don\u2019t bow before the chance for safety are remembered\n\n\ud83c\udf04  Lastly, the furnace will be turned up seven-fold in the coming years."}

Likely the religion from which the \"beast with one horn whose head was fatally wounded and yet healed\" springs forth in Biblical prophecy. \n\nRevelation 14:\n\"9 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,\n 10 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:\"\n\nRev 14:9-10\n \nAt first conventional thought seems logical. But with deeper study...\n \nThe Greek word here for 'take' [the mark] is \"lam-ban'-o\"\n \nA PROLONGED form of a primary verb, 'to take' - (TO CONTINUALLY TAKE) And it is exclusive of the subjective, more passive form of the word 'to offer or be offered' and the more invasive form of 'being forced.' Again, in the original Greek an 'ongoing commitment' is required for this verse to apply. They must possess the mark on the day of Jesus' return.\n \nIf someone comes to me and says, I took the chip. What must I do to be saved. I will not coldly turn them away to hell, as Satan would have me do. I would instruct them to do as Jesus instructed them to do in that situation. \"Cut it out! Renounce your oath to Satan! And accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior!\" Jesus gave them a way out to the very last. So will I. Jesus went down into the pit of Hell and set captives free. God would that NONE would PERISH!!!\n\nAs I showed in the video, some people already have taken th chip, cut it out and renounced Satan, accepting the Lord. I will NOT tell them, that because they did so and yet cut it out and renounced their oath to Satan, receiving the Lord as their Savior, they can't be saved, when many, MANY ex-Satanists have already done so! Why do you think Jesus said times are coming that if your hand offends you cut it off [out] in order to enter the kingdom of God??? \n\n\nDo you want to be saved?  Do you want to know that you will be with Yeshua (Jesus) when you leave this world?\n\n\nROAD TO SALVATION\n\nRomans 10\n\" 9 If you confess with your mouth, \"Jesus is Lord,\" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.\"\n\n\nPRAYER OF SALVATION\n\n\"God in Heaven, I believe Your Son Jesus Christ came to earth, died on the cross for my sins and that You raised him from the dead! Forgive me of my sins because of his blood. Jesus be MY Saviour and Lord. Thank you for your salvation. In Jesus name.

What are its end goals? When will they be achieved? Does SpaceX really plan to send humans to Mars and even start colonization there?\n\nPerhaps one of the most confounding things about SpaceX to most people is the issue of how its entire system works. People have heard terms such as Starship and Falcon 9 but they don't really grasp the specifics of them. You can't blame anyone for not comprehending how these things work and why they function and what their true purposes are. There is a lot of nuance and subtleties about SpaceX that people don't understand - especially when it comes to its state-of-the-art vehicles.\n\nSo let's take a good, hard look at Starship and the Super Heavy booster that powers it. Together, these two creations are the lynchpins behind everything that SpaceX is working on. Without Starship and Super Heavy, SpaceX is just running on hopes and dreams. Yes, it is these two revolutionary inventions that will propel the company forward, up into the stars, and possibly all the way to a trillion dollar valuation.\n\n\nThumbnail Render:\nSam Taylor: https://twitter.com/solarxploration\n\nVideo Renderings:\nDeepSpaceCourier: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHdi4L0qHu8wgVFt9Of3G1g\nErcXSpace: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrWwsY8pjDRcn-73LnDyChg\nIamVisuals: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRsL4NZ_7btb10YZzfnWY7w\nC-Bass Productions: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxnH8AW5-zlEZkmdHx95HLw\nSpaceXVision: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjeJp0R7lIkyKA83LEKkiPQ\nTijnM: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDA8yz_nQY-0Uxd96-qxYjA\nJochem Laurenssen: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8UlEk1Qvkyy5_kA5HZcTkw\nAlexanderSvan: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFtAc_KRuj4mrr0bVMZMn2w\n\n\nSubscribe Here \u27a1 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYYUGTG__Kc_4RBhv7FEolg/?sub_confirmation=1\n \nWATCH NEXT \ud83d\udc47\nElon Musk Reveals Plan To Colonize Mars \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXPj66c_dqA&list=PLaC8bl-mfsFf1SXQSFZkYDoTDa72-AvoD \n\n#Voyager #SpaceX"}

With a heavy heart at the final farewell of actor Dustin Hoffman, he has been confirmed as..\n\n#dustinhoffman \n\nDustin Lee Hoffman (born August 8, 1937) is an American actor and filmmaker. He is known for his versatile portrayals of antiheroes and emotionally vulnerable characters. He is the recipient of numerous accolades including two Academy Awards, five Golden Globe Awards, four British Academy Film Awards, three Drama Desk Awards, and two Primetime Emmy Awards. Hoffman has received numerous honors including the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1997, the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1999, and the Kennedy Center Honors Award in 2012.[2][3] Actor Robert De Niro described him as \"an actor with the everyman's face who embodied the heartbreakingly human\".[4]\n\nAt a young age Hoffman knew he wanted to study in the arts, and entered into the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music; later he decided to go into acting, for which he trained at the Pasadena Playhouse in Los Angeles. He soon starred in the 1966 off-Broadway play Eh? for which he received a Drama Desk Award.[5] His breakthrough role was as Benjamin Braddock in Mike Nichols' critically acclaimed and iconic film The Graduate (1967), for which he received his first Academy Award nomination. His next role was \"Ratso\" Rizzo in John Schlesinger's Midnight Cowboy (1969), in which he acted alongside Jon Voight; they both received Oscar nominations, and the film went on to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. He gained success in the 1970s crossing genres effortlessly in the western Little Big Man (1970), the prison drama Papillon (1973), and thriller Marathon Man (1976). He also played real life figures: comedian Lenny Bruce in Bob Fosse's Lenny (1975), and journalist Carl Bernstein in All the President's Men (1976). Hoffman starred opposite Meryl Streep in the family drama Kramer vs. Kramer (1979), for which they both received Academy Awards.[6]\n\nAfter a three-year break from films, Hoffman returned in Sydney Pollack's show business comedy Tootsie (1982) about a struggling actor who pretends to be a woman in order to get an acting role. He returned to stage acting with a 1984 performance as Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman and reprised the role a year later in a television film earning a Primetime Emmy Award.[4] In 1987 he starred in Elaine May's comedy Ishtar.[7] He won his second Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the autistic savant Ray Babbitt in the 1988 film Rain Man, co-starring Tom Cruise.[4] In 1989, he was nominated for a Tony Award and a Drama Desk Award for playing Shylock in a stage performance of The Merchant of Venice.[5] In the 1990s, he acted in such films as Dick Tracy (1990), Hook (1991), Outbreak (1995), Sleepers (1996), and Wag the Dog (1997).\n\nIn the 21st century, Hoffman has appeared in films such as Finding Neverland (2004), I Heart Huckabees (2004), and Stranger than Fiction (2006), as well as Meet the Fockers (2004) and Little Fockers (2010). Hoffman has done voice work for The Tale of Despereaux (2008) and the Kung Fu Panda film series (2008\u20132016). In 2012, he made his directorial debut with Quartet starring Maggie Smith and Tom Courtenay which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. In 2017, Hoffman starred in Noah Baumbach's critically acclaimed family drama The Meyerowitz Stories.\n\nDustin Lee Hoffman was born on August 8, 1937, in Los Angeles, California, the second son of Harry Hoffman (1908\u20131987) and Lillian (n\u00e9e Gold; 1909\u20131982).[8] His father worked as a prop supervisor (set decorator) at Columbia Pictures before becoming a furniture salesman.[9]\n\nHoffman was named after stage and silent screen actor Dustin Farnum.[10] His elder brother, Ronald, is a lawyer and economist. Hoffman is Jewish,[11][12] from an Ashkenazi Jewish family of immigrants from Kyiv, Ukraine (then a part of the Russian Empire), and Ia\u0219i, Romania. The family's surname was spelled \u0413\u043e\u0439\u0445\u043c\u0430\u043d (Goikhman) in the Russian Empire.[10][13][14][15][16]\n\nHis upbringing was nonreligious, and he has said, \"I don't have any memory of celebrating holidays growing up that were Jewish\", and that he had \"realized\" he was Jewish at around the age of 10.[17][18][19]\n\nHoffman graduated from Los Angeles High School in 1955 and enrolled at Santa Monica College with the intention of studying medicine. He left after a year to join the Pasadena Playhouse,[20] although when he told his family about his career goal, his Aunt Pearl warned him, \"You can't be an actor. You are not good-looking enough.\"[21][22] He also studied with Lee Strasberg and has stated that he did not study with either Sanford Meisner or Stella Adler."}

Are we just a few years away from living on the moon? Is Elon Musk about to finally make his science fiction fantasy into a reality?\n\nElon Musk isn\u2019t someone who accepts the status quo when it comes to technology and space travel. He likes to reach for the stars - literally. For years now he has been talking about creating cities on the moon and even Mars. In fact, his ambitious plans have included ships to Mars by the year 2022 and an established city on its surface by the year 2050. Obviously, those plans are fluid and may not be met but the fact that Musk is talking about them as a real possibility shows just how serious he is. \n\nBack in 2017, Musk showed off pictures of his ideal moon base but it was always in tandem with bigger plans to make it to Mars as well. And, of course, not a lot of information about this proposed moon base was given. But the image told quite the tale. It showed multiple gray, round domes, much like the ones you would see in a sci-fi book. These domed environments would house astronauts and scientists, as well as dozens of vehicles to better explore the surface of the moon. \n\nMusk has also suggested that the SpaceX Starship would be a major part of colonizing the moon. He has suggested that it would somehow be a pivotal part of our home on the moon, tentatively titled Moon Base Alpha. How? We aren\u2019t entirely sure but obviously Starship would do more than simply get astronauts to the moon, it would help them live on it.\n\nThumbnail 3d Artist:\nErc X\nhttps://twitter.com/ErcXspace\n\nSubscribe Here \u27a1 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYYUGTG__Kc_4RBhv7FEolg/?sub_confirmation=1\n \nWATCH NEXT \ud83d\udc47\nElon Musk Reveals Plan To Colonize Mars \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXPj66c_dqA&list=PLaC8bl-mfsFf1SXQSFZkYDoTDa72-AvoD \n\n#Voyager #SpaceX #ElonMusk"}

The avation medicine community hasn't formally recognized aerotoxic syndrome, but affected aircrew and passengers are increasingly speaking out against the phenomenon.\nAs of September 2010, researchers are actively working on diagnostics to explain aerotoxic syndrome, but no authoritative conclusions have been published.\nSources of Aerotoxic Syndrome\nToday's airplanes (with the exception of the new Boeing 787) use a cabin air system that mixes filtered recirculated air with compressed engine bleed air. While the air filters remove viruses and bacteria, they don't remove engine fumes or vapors. If there's a leak in the engine compression section, there's a chance that those chemicals could become incorporated in the bleed air circulated in the airplane cabin. A jet-fuel additive called tricresyl phosphate, or TCP, is believed to be the toxic chemical that causes aerotoxic syndrome when it's inhaled.\nA \"fume event\" occurs when TCP mixes with compressed hot air in a particularly high concentration. During a fume event, passengers may see smoke and fumes in the airplane cabin, and they're particularly at risk for aerotoxic symdrome.\nSymptoms of Aerotoxic Syndrome\nThe symptoms of aerotoxic syndrome vary widely in scope and intensity. They may appear during a flight or several days afterward.\nShort-Term Effects of Aerotoxic Syndrome (1, 2)\n\u00b7 Neurotoxic symptoms include disorientation, blurred vision, vertigo, tunnel vision, shaking, tremors, parathesias, loss of consciousness, seizures, and loss of balance.\n\u00b7 Neuropsychological symptoms include headache, feeling intoxicated, confusion, memory impairment, and dizziness or lightheadedness.\n\u00b7 Nausea, vomiting, tinnitus, and irritation of nose, eyes and upper airways.\n\u00b7 Increased heart rate, breathing difficulties, cough, heart palpitations, chest tightness, respiratory failure and shortness of breath.\nLong-Term Effects of Aerotoxic Syndrome (1) \n\u00b7 Parasthesias or numbness in the limbs, fingers or lips.\n\u00b7 Memory impairment, severe headaches, sleep disorders, forgetfulness, dizziness, loss of balance, lack of coordination.\n\u00b7 Chest pain, weakness and fatigue, hot flashes, increased heart rate, exhaustion, muscle weakness, muscle and joint pain, heart palpitations.\n\u00b7 Salivation, vomiting and nausea, diarrhea, hair loss, skin blisters, skin rashes and itching.\n\u00b7 Eye irritation, upper airway and nose irritation, signs of immunosuppresion and chemical sensitivity.\n\n\n\n\nDO YOU WANT SALVATION IN JESUS CHRIST?\n\nDo you want to know that you will be with Yeshua (Jesus) when you leave this world?\n\n\nROAD TO SALVATION\n\nRomans 10\n\" 9 If you confess with your mouth, \"Jesus is Lord,\" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.\"\n\n\nPRAYER OF SALVATION\n\n\"God in Heaven, I believe Your Son Jesus Christ came to earth, died on the cross for my sins and that You raised him from the dead! Forgive me of my sins because of his blood. Jesus be MY Saviour and Lord. Thank you for your salvation. In Jesus name. Amen.\"\n\n\n\n\nSources:\n\n20130310_153234.mp4 \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXHZx6ZqXLc\nUploaded by: Bobby Mann\n\nLater today \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ogEYSHxPXk\nUploaded by Bobby Mann\nWhat in the World Are They Spraying?

I've put the link you sent me in the \n\ndescription and first I'll read what Secret Agent MGTOW said and then I'll give everyone my opinion. Here's what Secret Agent says and I quote: \"I dont say this to scare anyone or change peoples behavior or anything. Being informed is \n\nthe sole point. It helps make for better understanding and responses, if any are desired. MGTOW is scaring the absolute s~~~ out of the societal powers that be. They are going full scale Alinsky against it. It is doing this in various \n\nways. Number 1. Women try to make their fake WGTOW group, as if anyone in the know believes that. It's a really poor and transparent unoriginal mimic attempt on their part to show hey, we do it too. Number 2. The libtard feminist media \n\nis pushing hard on articles getting mgtow wrong, and another slew of articles about why nothing in a womans life is her fault, ever. Number 3. They are actually trying to get lover dolls banned for men, despite women using toys and \n\ndolls themselves. Under the false guise of abuse to women. Missing the point these men want nothing to do with real women in the first place. Number 4. The press and feminists are painting mgtow men as emasculated, afraid of women, \n\nliving in basements, poor, jobless, no woman would want them, ie attacking and destroying the character of the enemy."}

He wants me to cover the strange case of Amber Heard quitting Hollyweird and moving to Madrid, Spain. And nothing of value was lost. Her career looks like the character she played in the recent version of the stand after she jumped off a skycraper. We all know that it's Hollywood that quit her first. Now if only she would take Megan Markle with her there would be justice in this world. She says she's probably write a book and we all know she's going to make millions off it and hopefully she trips up and Depp sues her for libel. She has a two year old daughter named Oonah that she had through surrogacy. She won't say who the father is but I'm guessing it's Elon Musk and he's probably paying her living expenses after Depp sued her into oblivion. She's bilingual in Spanish and is happy there, raising her daughter away from all the noise. One of her old friends shared this information and said that she's in no hurry to work in Hollywood. That's ok because they aren't in a hurry to hire her back. Plus she's 37 so in a few years the only roles she would be able to get if she hadn't destroyed her career are those of a mother. We don't know 100% that she's moved to Spain but she sold her Yucca Valley, Calif., home in July 2022 for $1.1 million and has been spending a ton of time in Spain. The court ordered her to pay $10 million in damages plus another 350k for writing that Cry Baby article hit piece about him in 2018. After losing in court and hopefully she brought her own bedsheets to Spain. I think Depp won't even take all the money. And if he does again I think that Musk might be supporting her to raise a kid that might be theirs. Again lots of speculation. She won't say who's kid it is but she was involved with Musk and was cheating on Depp with him. Now that she's done with Hollywoke, more like they are done with her I'm thinking of the Lonely Fans opportunities this opens up. She could also moonlight on some Dubai Porta Potty action. She's already auditioned on Depps bed sheets or should I call them bed shits. I'll discuss more in a moment but let me first tell everyone about today's sponsor Haakon The Good:\n\n\n\n\n\n10 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com.

So we're gonna talk about what happens when a women sense that you're over-pursuing. \n\nYou see it's natural to ask a woman out but the problem is you sticking around even if she already shows her uncertainty. Over-pursuing is when you do not let women come to you or give them space to chase because you're always there and you're always persistent. So what happens when you over-pursue?\n\nOne, the person gets cocky. Chasing lowers your value and they're gonna think something is wrong with you. You see when they sense weakness in you they'll test you. And they raise their price and see how far can you get.\n\nThis test will determine everything that will happen. If you pass they will respect you but that doesn't mean they'll stop testing you. But if you fail they will think you're pathetic and even though they stay with you they will secretly look for someone to replace you. And just continue to take advantage of you.\n\nAlways remember that people want somebody whom they respect. And if you give them the gift of respecting you they will appreciate it. Humans cannot respect and say no to somebody whom they can take advantage of without getting hurt in the process. So you have to make sure to value self-respect over relationship and him/her respecting over anything.\n\nDo not tolerate inconsistencies because it is the only thing that can change them. You cannot change the way they treat you by complaining. \n\nRead more here: https://mindfulattraction.org/how-over-pursuing-a-woman-changes-the-way-she-sees-you/"}

So the Lord said to Solomon, \u201cBecause you have done this, and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely ear the kingdom from you, and will give it to your servant.\u201d\n\n1 Kings 3 10-12\n10 The Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked for this. 11 So God said to him, \u201cSince you have asked for this and not for long life or wealth for yourself, nor have asked for the death of your enemies but for discernment in administering justice, 12 I will do what you have asked. I will give you a wise and discerning heart, so that there will never have been anyone like you, nor will there ever be. \n\nTakeaways:\n\ud83c\udf05  The insatiability of a man\u2019s heart - the misconception of sex in marriage\n\n\ud83c\udf05   Many women lead to spiritual lukewarmness\n\n \ud83c\udf05  No man is unsusceptible - red pills must always be consumed\n\n\ud83c\udf05   What does this say about women as well - Hypergamy has always existed\n\n#hoodiesup"}

Winslet then eschewed parts in blockbusters in favour of critically acclaimed period pieces, including Quills (2000) and Iris (2001).\n\nThe science fiction romance Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), in which Winslet was cast against type in a contemporary setting, proved to be a turning point in her career, and she gained further recognition for her performances in Finding Neverland (2004), Little Children (2006), Revolutionary Road (2008), and The Reader (2008). For playing a former Nazi camp guard in the latter, she won the BAFTA Award and the Academy Award for Best Actress. Winslet's portrayal of Joanna Hoffman in the biopic Steve Jobs (2015) won her another BAFTA Award, and she received two Primetime Emmy Awards for her performances in the HBO miniseries Mildred Pierce (2011) and Mare of Easttown (2021).\n\nFor her narration of a short story in the audiobook Listen to the Storyteller (1999), Winslet won a Grammy Award. She performed the song \"What If\" for the soundtrack of her film Christmas Carol: The Movie (2001). A co-founder of the charity Golden Hat Foundation, which aims to create autism awareness, Winslet has written a book on the topic. Divorced from film directors Jim Threapleton and Sam Mendes, Winslet has been married to businessman Edward Abel Smith[a] since 2012. She has a child from each marriage.\n\nWinslet was among 175 girls to audition for Peter Jackson's psychological drama Heavenly Creatures (1994), and was cast after impressing Jackson with the intensity she brought to her part.[29] The New Zealand-based production is based on the Parker\u2013Hulme murder case of 1954, in which Winslet played Juliet Hulme, a teenager who assists her friend, Pauline Parker (played by Melanie Lynskey), in the murder of Pauline's mother. She prepared for the part by reading the transcripts of the girls' murder trial, their letters and diaries, and interacted with their acquaintances.[30] She has said she learnt tremendously from the job.[9] Jackson filmed in the real murder locations, and the experience left Winslet traumatised.[15] She found it difficult to detach herself from her character, and said that after returning home, she often cried.[30] The film was a critical breakthrough for Winslet;[31][32] Desson Thomson, a reviewer for The Washington Post, called her \"a bright-eyed ball of fire, lighting up every scene she's in\".[33] Winslet recorded \"Juliet's Aria\" for the film's soundtrack.[34] Also that year, she appeared as Geraldine Barclay, a prospective secretary, in the Royal Exchange Theatre production of Joe Orton's farce What the Butler Saw.[35]\n\nWhile promoting Heavenly Creatures in Los Angeles, Winslet auditioned for the minor part of Lucy Steele for a 1995 film adaptation of Jane Austen's novel Sense and Sensibility, written by and starring Emma Thompson. Impressed by her reading, Thompson cast her in the much larger part of the recklessly romantic teenager Marianne Dashwood.[36] The director Ang Lee wanted Winslet to play the part with grace and restraint\u2014aspects that he felt were missing from her performance in Heavenly Creatures\u2014and thus asked her to practise tai chi, read gothic literature, and learn to play the piano.[36] David Parkinson of Radio Times considered Winslet to be a standout among the cast, and Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle took note of how well she had portrayed her character's growth and maturity.[37][38] The film grossed over $134 million worldwide.[39] She won the Screen Actors Guild and British Academy Film Award for Best Supporting Actress, and received nominations for the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award in the same category.[40] Also in 1995, Winslet featured in the poorly received Disney film A Kid in King Arthur's Court."}

You can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 24/7 at 988. \n\nAs the second leading cause of death (after accidents) for people aged 10 to 34, suicide is a serious public health problem. Learn more about suicide prevention at www.psychiatry.org/suicide. \n\nIn 2020 in the United States, over 45,000 people died by suicide. An estimated 1.4 million adults attempt suicide each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). More than one in five people who died by suicide had expressed their suicide intent.\n\n\nMen are more than three times more likely than women to take their lives. Firearms are the most common method of suicide (used in about half of all suicides).\n\nYet, suicide is preventable. Knowing the risk factors and recognizing the warning signs for suicide can help prevent suicide.\n\nRisk Factors, Warning Signs and Protective Factors\nSuicide is linked to mental disorders, particularly depression and alcohol use disorders, and the strongest risk factor for suicide is a previous suicide attempt.\n\nThe Suicide Prevention Resource Center defines risk and protective factors and warning signs:\n\nRisk factors are characteristics that make it more likely that an individual will consider, attempt or die by suicide.\nWarning signs indicate an immediate risk of suicide.\nProtective factors are characteristics that make it less likely that individuals will consider, attempt or die by suicide.\nRisk Factors for Suicide\nCertain events and circumstances may increase risk (not in particular order, except first one).\n\nPrevious suicide attempt(s)\nA history of suicide in the family\nSubstance misuse\nMood disorders (depression, bipolar disorder)\nAccess to lethal means (e.g., keeping firearms in the home)\nLosses and other events (for example, the breakup of a relationship or a death, academic failures, legal difficulties, financial difficulties, bullying)\nHistory of trauma or abuse\nChronic physical illness, including chronic pain\nExposure to the suicidal behavior of others\nIn some cases, a recent stressor or sudden catastrophic event, failure or can leave people feeling desperate, unable to see a way out, and become a \"tipping point\" toward suicide."}

All the way back in 1902, Georges Melies\u2019 short film, A Trip to the Moon, showcased a future where Earthlings landed and tried to live peacefully only to be met with harsh resistance from native aliens.\n\nYes, we have always had a fascination with the long term presence on the moon yet it has never come to be. While it seemed that things were headed in that direction in the  1960s, at the height of the space race, the moon was only visited briefly. The idea of massive, futuristic moon bases filled with everyday citizens has so far remained a fantasy left in books and movies.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t still a chance of lunar bases in the future. In fact, NASA is currently putting together ambitious plans to create a safe, sound moon base that will be inhabited by humans and will also help propel the people of Earth to Mars and beyond. So what power source are they looking to use to get this moon base up and running? None other than nuclear power.

Next, each team must duplicate the recipe based on their guess for celebrity judges chef Curtis Stone and cake artist Yolanda Gampp. To take the $100,000 prize, the competing dessert makers will need to prove they have the technical know-how, imagination and problem-solving skills needed to decode and re-create incredible desserts and cakes from across the world.\n\nFOX on Social:\nFollow FOX on Instagram: http://instagram.com/FOXTV \nLike FOX on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/FOXTV \nFollow FOX on Twitter: \u202a\u202c\u202chttps://www.twitter.com/FOXTV\nFollow FOX on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@foxtv \n\n\nSeason 2 Episode 5 Recap | Crime Scene Kitchen\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/FoodClubFOX\n\n#FoodClub #CrimeSceneKitchen #JoelMcHale"}

Some have gone on to say that our thoughts can impact the expression of these genes as well. With this in mind, it should be at least somewhat reasonable to understand that the law of attraction can be used to change your appearance. Many bodybuilders such as Arnold Schwarzenegger have given credence to this. Schwarzenegger, for instance, would visualize the growth of his muscles, and he claimed this was the secret to how to manifest your dream body. There are also very dramatic examples of people using visualizations to affect the inspired actions they ended up taken. In my own case, using some of these techniques was incredibly helpful in making my skin glow, and making my physique relatively lean and strong.\n\nWith love and respect,\nNikhil\n\nHere's an article on how diet can affect your epigenetics:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21401888\n\n-------------------------------\nhttps://www.instagram.com/nrajapandey\n-------------------------------\nOutro is by independent artist Mike Archangelo.

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "Importing Foreign Brides - MGTOW \"Hello Sandman, I have been single for many years, perhaps unconsciously knowing I\u2019m better off going it alone. Your analyses confirm how I feel given my few sad experiences with, what I eventually discovered to be, abusive women. No, I am not playing the victim card; I am living and learning. I\u2019ve realized that falling in love with a woman you like blinds you to the subtle manipulations, or verbal abuse, until the shrill shatters the glass bell jar and you regain consciousness after the blow. I can now see the red flags before they\u2019re even raised and have managed to keep myself out of trouble for a good long while. But other times it seems like a disadvantage in not allowing myself to be vulnerable. I must admit that for many years I respected women because of the respect I felt for my mother as an amazingly unique, humble, wise and kind woman. With my sister, however, I had a friendly yet distant relationship. In this light I accepted feminism until only just recently, once it became clear to me the new wave is really about gaining additional legal powers without balancing responsibilities, and what I see repeatedly happening in the courtroom. Amazingly, some of these facts I\u2019ve weaned from women themselves, such as Diana Davidson, Janice Fiamengo, ChristyoMisty, Karen Straughan, Helen Smith; women who have impressed me as our best defenders. When my mother died a few years ago, I understood the nature of my relationship with my sister. She became highly deceitful and manipulative as she deliberately concealed my mother\u2019s will from me, wherein I later discovered she had named me as her executor for a small property she left behind but my sister decided to keep for herself. But never mind this family dynamic. I think what I am trying to get at is that despite all I know now and years of undefined self exile or MGTOW, I still feel a longing for caring female companionship. The easy question is, how do I get over it, exactly? Yes, I have my job and my hobbies, but still, is this romanticized notion absolutely always just smoke and mirrors? You once talked briefly about Eastern European women and how they take better care of themselves, and how they have to work harder for a limited supply of Alpha males, or Beta, or whatever. I had an opportunity to see this first hand while volunteering at an English School in Ukraine. The population of females there appears to be skewed in favor of men. Yet many women appear to have trouble with and reject their own society men because of alcohol addiction, gender abuse, or the serious lack of opportunities for men to excel within their post-Russian society. \n\n\n\n\n\n10 pictures paid for and licensed through BigStock.com (In order of appearance)\n\n1.

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "Everyone loved Tim Conway was RUINED after these dirty SECRETS came out Everyone loved Tim Conway was RUINED after these dirty SECRETS came out\n\n#Timcoway\n\nThomas Daniel \"Tim\" Conway (December 15, 1933 \u2013 May 14, 2019)[1][2][3][4] was an American actor, comedian, writer, and director. From 1966 to 2012 he appeared in more than 100 TV shows, TV series and films. Among his more notable roles, he portrayed the inept Ensign Parker in the 1960s World War II TV situation comedy McHale's Navy, was a regular cast member (1975\u20131978) on the TV comedy The Carol Burnett Show where he portrayed his recurrent iconic characters Mister Tudball, the Oldest Man and the Dumb Private, co-starred with Don Knotts in several films (1975\u201380), was the title character in the Dorf series of eight sports comedy direct-to-video films (1987\u20131996), and provided the voice of Barnacle Boy in the animated series SpongeBob SquarePants (1999\u20132012). Twice, in 1970 and in 1980\u20131981, he had his own TV series.\n\nConway was admired for his ability to depart from scripts with humorous ad libs and gestures, which frequently caused others in the skit to break character while attempting to control their surprise and laughter. He won six Primetime Emmy Awards during his career, four of which were awarded for The Carol Burnett Show, including one for writing.\n\nConway was born Thomas Daniel Conway 1 on December 15, 1933, in Willoughby, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, and grew up in nearby Chagrin Falls, the son of Daniel and Sophia (n\u00e9e Murgoiu) Conway. Daniel was a groomer for polo ponies.[3][5][6][7] His father, who immigrated to the United States in 1927,[8] was born in Ireland to Scottish parents and his mother was a first-generation Romanian-American.[3]\n\nConway's legal name was Thomas, though he was also referred to as Toma, the Romanian language analogue,1 and was typically known as Tom; he changed his stage name to Tim near the beginning of his acting career (quipping he \"dotted the O\") to avoid confusion with British actor Tom Conway.[5][9][10]\n\nConway attended Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio, where he majored in television and radio and was a disc jockey,[11] and a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity.[12] When he graduated, Conway enlisted in the United States Army, where he served between 1956 and 1958.\n\nIn 2007, Conway met filmmaker Pasquale Murena when Murena was brought in to direct additional scenes and edit the direct-to-DVD film Legend of the Paddle, starring Conway.[43] The two men subsequently worked together on numerous productions, including Murena producing the DVD releases of Together Again with Tim and Harvey, the re-releases of Tim and Harvey in The Great Outdoors, Dorf on Golf, and Dorf Goes Fishing. Murena directed, produced and co-wrote with Conway six Dorf comedy sketches for the DVD release of The Ultimate Dorf DVD Collection, which has sold over 3 million copies.[44]\n\nStarting in 2009, the two men collaborated on their first sketches for the website iSpotSanta, where Dorf helps Santa deliver presents, and works at the North Pole as Santa's #1 elf. The two men did over 25 comedy sketches and three short films for the website, while garnering over 35 million viewers.[45] Conway was quoted in an interview on the Disney Channel, stating that, \"Pasquale has done more with Dorf than I ever imagined. We love making these films for kids.\" Continuing their success, Murena cast Conway as Professor VanVanGuard in his award-winning first feature film in 2014 called, Chip & Bernie's Zomance, with Conway adding his unique humor to this zombie film.\n\nConway was married to Mary Anne Dalton from 1961 until 1978, and they had six children together.[11] He was married to Charlene Fusco from May 18, 1984 until his death. Her daughter, Jacqueline \"Jackie\" Beatty, became Tim's stepdaughter, giving him seven children altogether."}

Zack is a barista who doesn't make big tips, and Miri isn't exactly making top dollar either. Friends since grade school, they share a cramped apartment together, but the bills are piling up faster than their paychecks. Then, at their class reunion, the two friends meet up with a former classmate who's shot to success in the adult film industry. Inspired after a YouTube video of Miri in her granny panties goes viral, Zack and his roommate round up a crew and begin production on their masterpiece. When the time comes for Zack and Miri to shoot their first scene together, however, unexpected emotions start to bubble to the surface, prompting them both to wonder if they've somehow mistaken true love for mere friendship all these years.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \u00a9 The Weinstein Company (2008)\nCast: Seth Rogen, Craig Robinson, Gerry Bednob\nDirector: Kevin Smith\nProducers: Carla Gardini, Laura Greenlee, Scott Mosier, Bob Weinstein, Harvey Weinstein, Leslie Rodier\nScreenwriter: Kevin Smith\n\nWHO ARE WE?\nThe MOVIECLIPS channel is the largest collection of licensed movie clips on the web.

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "Carousel Rider of my Dreams - MGTOW Carousel Rider of my Dreams - MGTOW\n\n\nMGTOW Mystery Link: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xvn9m7\n\n\nHi Everyone Sandman Here,\n\nThis video is brought to you by a donation from Daniel and here's what he has to say: \"Hi Sandman, This is my first time donating and it won't be my last as I have many questions that I think would make good topics. I think your insight is invaluable to men living in the modern world and the daily dose of redpill wisdom from your channel has been a key part of getting my head right and my priorities sraight, for this I am truely thankful. I'm 26 and the only \nrelationship I've ever been in was my high school sweetheart. We broke up after about a year but she insisted that we stay friends and would rebound back to me in between her other relationships, all the while using me as an emotional tampon, effectively stringing me along by saying she still loved me and that I was her closest friend for what ended up being more than three years. I ended up moving to North Dakota and have since become a successful oilfield worker. During this time she had multiple boyfriends and slept around with dozens of guys and would often call me drunk and crying after her one night stands. Because of this I never got closure, just as I was starting to get over her she would call out of the blue to catch up and tell me how much she missed me and that I needed to come visit her, which I foolishly did multiple times. As a result I ended up developing depression and pretty bad drug and alcohol problem to self medicate my one-itis. Eventuaully I stopped replying to her many contact attempts, she tried using shaming language to get me to talk to her so I blocked her on all social media and her phone number. Its been two years since I've heard a word from her and I've never been happier. My problem is every so often she will pop up in my dreams. When I think of her when I'm awake I can catch myself quickly and derail the thought rather than dwelling on it. Normally my dreams are more random and easy to forget, but for some reason when I dream of her they are unbelievably vivid, and I haven't figured out how to tell that I'm dreaming. They suck me in and seem almost more real than life itself. When I wake up I'm distraught and those thoughts stick with me for a few days, it's at these times I think about using again. I hope your unique perspective on sleep might shed some light on my situation. Keep up the good work.\" Well Daniel thanks for the donation and topic. Her appearing in your subconscious mind is obviously your repressed feelings about her over the last couple of years after you stopped talking to her. She was your high school sweetheart during the most formative years of your life. She's going to be a phantom that pops into your dreams from time to time. My ex of ten years still appears once in a while and it's almost been five years now. This is to be expected. But the ex girlfriend I had from the age of the twenty to twenty-five she's long gone. I don't dream of her at all. The women I was with more recently they aren't even there. In your case Daniel there are two things making this situation what it is. First she is and will always be your high school sweetheart. She's your Jenny and you're Forest Gump.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com.

Known for both his comedic and dramatic roles, he is one of the most popular and recognizable film stars worldwide, and is regarded as an American cultural icon.[2] Hanks's films have grossed more than $4.9 billion in North America and more than $9.96 billion worldwide,[3] making him the fourth-highest-grossing actor in North America.[4]\n\nHanks made his breakthrough with leading roles in a series of comedy films which received positive media attention, such as Splash (1984), The Money Pit (1986), Big (1988) and A League of Their Own (1992). He won two consecutive Academy Awards for Best Actor for starring as a gay lawyer suffering from AIDS in Philadelphia (1993) and the title character in Forrest Gump (1994).[5] Hanks collaborated with film director Steven Spielberg on five films: Saving Private Ryan (1998), Catch Me If You Can (2002), The Terminal (2004), Bridge of Spies (2015), and The Post (2017), as well as the HBO miniseries Band of Brothers (2001), and The Pacific (2010) which launched him as a director, producer, and screenwriter. Hanks's other films include the romantic comedies Sleepless in Seattle (1993) and You've Got Mail (1998); the dramas Apollo 13 (1995), The Green Mile (1999), Cast Away (2000), Road to Perdition (2002), and Cloud Atlas (2012); and the biographical dramas Charlie Wilson's War (2007), Captain Phillips (2013), Saving Mr. Banks (2013), Sully (2016), A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (2019), News of the World (2020), and Elvis (2022). He has also appeared as the title character in the Robert Langdon film series, and voiced Sheriff Woody in the Toy Story film series (1995\u2013present).\n\nHanks's accolades include two Academy Awards out of six nominations. Hanks has also won seven Primetime Emmy Awards for his work as a producer of various limited series and television movies, including From the Earth to the Moon, Band of Brothers, John Adams, and The Pacific. In 2013, he received a Tony Award nomination for Best Actor in a Play for his performance in Nora Ephron's Lucky Guy. He has received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 2002. He received the Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award for Excellence in Film from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 2004.[6] In 2014, he received a Kennedy Center Honor, and in 2016, he received a Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama,[7] as well as the French Legion of Honor.[8] In 2020, he received the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award.\n\nThomas Jeffrey Hanks[9] was born in Concord, California, on July 9, 1956,[10][11] to hospital worker Janet Marylyn (n\u00e9e Frager)[12] and itinerant[13] cook Amos \"Bud\"[14][15] Hanks. His mother was from a Portuguese family; their surname was originally \"Fraga\".[16] His father had English ancestry,[17] and through his line, Hanks is a distant cousin of President Abraham Lincoln[18][19][20][21][22] and children's host Fred Rogers, whom he played.[23][24] His parents divorced in 1960. Their three oldest children, Sandra (later Sandra Hanks Benoiton, a writer),[25] Larry (who became an entomology professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign),[26] and Tom, went with their father, while the youngest, Jim (who also became an actor and filmmaker), remained with their mother in Red Bluff, California.[27] In his childhood, Hanks's family moved often; by the age of 10, he had lived in 10 different houses.[28]\n\nWhile Hanks's family religious history was Catholic and Mormon, one journalist characterized Hanks's teenage self as being a \"Bible-toting evangelical\" for several years.[29] In school, he was unpopular with students and teachers alike, later telling Rolling Stone magazine, \"I was a geek, a spaz. I was horribly, painfully, terribly shy. At the same time, I was the guy who'd yell out funny captions during filmstrips. But I didn't get into trouble. I was always a real good kid and pretty responsible.\"[30] In 1965, his father married Frances Wong, a San Francisco native of Chinese descent. Frances had three children, two of whom lived with Hanks during his high school years. Hanks acted in school plays, including South Pacific, while attending Skyline High School in Oakland, California.[31]\n\nHanks studied theater at Chabot College in Hayward, California,[32] and transferred to California State University, Sacramento after two years.[33][34] During a 2001 interview with sportscaster Bob Costas, Hanks was asked whether he would rather have an Oscar or a Heisman Trophy. He replied he would rather win a Heisman by playing halfback for the California Golden Bears.[35] He told New York magazine in 1986, \"Acting classes looked like the best place for a guy who liked to make a lot of noise and be rather flamboyant."}

He is best known for his partnership with Paul Simon in the folk rock duo Simon & Garfunkel.\n\nHighlights of Garfunkel's solo music career include one top-10 hit, three top-20 hits, six top-40 hits, 14 Adult Contemporary top-30 singles, five Adult Contemporary number ones, two UK number ones and a People's Choice Award. Through his solo and collaborative work, Garfunkel has earned eight Grammys, including a Lifetime Achievement Award.[1] In 1990, he and Simon were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2008, Garfunkel was ranked 86th in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time.\n\nGarfunkel was born in Forest Hills, Queens, New York City, the son of Rose (born Pearlman) and Jacob \"Jack\" Garfunkel, a traveling salesman. Art was a middle child with two brothers, the older Jules and the younger Jerome. Jacob's parents immigrated to the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century, and settled in Manhattan. Before his career in sales, Jacob worked as an actor in Dayton, Ohio.[3][4][5][6] Garfunkel is of Romanian-Jewish descent,[7] his paternal grandparents having emigrated from the city of Ia\u0219i. When he was young, he would often sing in synagogue.[8] His maternal cousin was Lou Pearlman,[9][10] founder of the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC.\n\nAccording to the Across America DVD, Garfunkel's love of singing originated in the first grade. \"When we were lined up in size order, and after everyone else had left, I'd stay behind and enjoy the echo sound of the stairwell tiles and sing 'Unchained Melody' and 'You'll Never Walk Alone', learning to love this goosebumps song from the tender age of five.\" Later, Garfunkel's father bought him a wire recorder and from then on, Garfunkel spent his afternoons singing, recording, and playing it back, so he could listen for flaws and learn how to improve.\n\nAt his bar mitzvah in 1954, Garfunkel performed as a cantor, singing over four hours of his repertoire for his family.[4] As a young teen, Garfunkel became ill with a lung infection, leading to a love for basketball. He explained in a 1998 interview: \"In the summer of '55, I had a lung infection. I couldn't run around, but I loved basketball and there was a hoop nearby. Much of the summer I spent methodically hitting 96, 98 foul shots out of 100. Then 102! I never played on a team after junior high school. Just 3 against 3, half court pick up games in the schoolyard.\"[11] He met future singing partner Paul Simon in the sixth grade at PS 164, when they were both cast in the elementary school graduation play, Alice in Wonderland.[12][13] It has been said by Garfunkel that Simon first became interested in singing after hearing Garfunkel sing a rendition of Nat King Cole's \"Too Young\" in a school talent show.[14]\n\nBetween 1956 and 1962, the two performed together as \"Tom & Jerry\", a moniker coined by their label Big Records, occasionally performing at school dances.[15] Their idols were The Everly Brothers, whom they imitated in their use of close two-part vocal harmony. In 1957, Simon & Garfunkel recorded the song \"Hey, Schoolgirl\" under the name Tom & Jerry.[15] The single reached number 49 on the pop charts.[16][17]\n\nAfter graduating from Forest Hills High School alongside Simon, Garfunkel initially majored in architecture at Columbia University, where he was a brother in the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity and lived in Carman Hall.[18][19] Garfunkel was a team member in tennis, skiing, fencing, and bowling at the college and also joined the all-male a cappella group on campus, the Columbia Kingsmen.[11][20] While at Columbia his roommate, Sanford Greenberg, developed glaucoma and went blind. Garfunkel assisted him in his homework by reading his textbooks to Greenberg, who went on to graduate with honors.[21] Greenberg later gave Garfunkel $500 to go and record a demo of \"The Sound of Silence\".[22] Garfunkel ultimately earned a BA in art history in 1965,[23][24] followed by an MA in mathematics education from Teachers College, Columbia University in 1967. He also completed coursework toward a doctorate in the latter discipline at Teachers College, Columbia University during the peak of Simon & Garfunkel's commercial success; however he later dropped out"}

As a child, he appeared in a 2008 stage production of A Christmas Carol and Mame, after which he starred in the television sitcom Melissa & Joey (2010\u20132015). He went on to play a supporting role in the adventure film Jurassic World (2015) and took on lead roles in several teen dramas, including The Kings of Summer (2013), The 5th Wave (2016), Everything, Everything (2017), and Love, Simon (2018). He has since starred in the miniseries A Teacher (2020) and Maid (2021).\n\nRobinson was born on March 22, 1995, in Seattle, Washington.[1][3][4] He has four younger siblings.[5] His mother is Denise Podnar.[6] Robinson initially attended Seattle Preparatory School, but left in the middle of his freshman year and moved to Los Angeles after booking a regular role on Melissa & Joey.[7] He graduated from Campbell Hall School in 2013.[8] He was accepted to New York University\u2019s College of Arts and Sciences and attended in the summer to work on another season of Melissa & Joey.\n\nRobinson made his professional acting debut at the age of eleven with a role in a stage adaptation of Charles Dickens' novel A Christmas Carol.[9] Talent scout Matt Casella recommended him to a few agencies and Robinson was eventually signed with the Los Angeles-based Savage Agency. Because of the 2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike, Robinson's family moved back to Washington where he continued to perform on stage in and around Seattle.[9][10]\n\nIn 2010, Robinson was cast in the role of Ryder Scanlon, the nephew of Melissa Joan Hart's character, on the ABC Family sitcom Melissa & Joey, playing the character until its cancellation in 2015.\n\nIn 2011, while on hiatus from Melissa & Joey, Robinson began filming of the Disney Channel original movie Frenemies; Robinson played the role of Jake Logan. Frenemies premiered in January 2012, on the Disney Channel.[11]\n\nIn 2012, Robinson was cast in the lead role of Joe Toy in director Jord Vogt-Roberts' The Kings of Summer.[12] He also guest-starred in the episode \"Blue Bell Boy,\" during the third season of HBO's Boardwalk Empire. He also began appearing in a series of television commercials for Cox Communications entitled \"Buffer Time is Bonding Time.\"\n\nIn 2015, Robinson portrayed Zach Mitchell in Jurassic World, in which he was widely seen.[13] He played Ben Parish in the film adaptation of the novel The 5th Wave, which was released in January 2016. These roles made him unavailable for multiple episodes of the final season of Melissa & Joey, but he returned for the final three episodes.[14]\n\nHe played the titular lead in independent film Being Charlie, a semi-autobiographical feature about director Rob Reiner's relationship with his son, which premiered at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival;[15] the film was released theatrically in 2016.\n\nIn 2017, he starred in William H. Macy's comedy-drama film Krystal,[16] and as Olly in Everything, Everything, a film adaptation of the novel of the same name.[17]\n\nIn 2018, Robinson starred as the titular Simon Spier in the gay coming out teen drama film Love, Simon. The film was considered ground-breaking because it was the first major studio film to focus on a gay, teenage romance.[18] Robinson's performance as Simon garnered critical acclaim. After reading the script, Robinson revealed that he broke his own rule to no longer play high schoolers because he saw the cultural importance of the film.[19] In 2019, he co-starred in the third film version of Richard Wright's Native Son.[20]\n\nIn 2020, Robinson co-starred in the FX miniseries A Teacher,[21] and he narrated his DM responses to the protagonist of Love, Victor, a Love, Simon spinoff TV series on Hulu, and appeared in two episodes of the show.[22][23] In 2021, he starred in the Netflix miniseries Maid, opposite Margaret Qualley and Andie MacDowell. The series was critically acclaimed, with Robinson getting praise for his performance."}

I was born and raised in a small country called Bulgaria but moved to Canada when i was about 13... I've been into video games since I can remember, and I finally decided to make a YouTube channel where I can share my tips, tricks, game-plays, and also other stuff that relate to gaming. Every now and then I also post Vlog's and other videos that might interest you... At the moment my goal is to reach 100,000 subscribers and so far it has been an uphill struggle. I am focused and plan to make my goals come true. With that said, on this channel I do my best to upload at least 1 video a day! I really do enjoy YouTube and providing content for others to watch and one day if all goes well I might even make this my full time job. For now though, I graduated from College and now I'm enrolled in University trying to complete that as well. Thank you for checking my bio, as well as watching my video.. If there is anything you would like to suggest feel free to leave a comment on the video! \n\nIf you would like to see me play a game, PLEASE LET ME KNOW! \n\nAlso this channel does accept user submitted clips, if you have something awesome you would want me to share...

We have very sad news about 51 year old actress Bridget Moynahan, she has been confirmed as..\n\n#Bridgetmoynahan\n\nKathryn Bridget Moynahan (born April 28, 1971) is an American actress and model. Moynahan is best known for her role as Erin Reagan in the police drama Blue Bloods. She graduated from Longmeadow High School in Massachusetts in 1989 and began pursuing a career in modeling. She appeared in department-store catalogs and magazines, and after doing television commercials, she began taking acting lessons. Moynahan made her television debut in a guest appearance in the comedy series Sex and the City in 1999, where she later had a recurring role as Natasha.\n\nShe made her feature-film debut in Coyote Ugly (2000). She had supporting roles in Serendipity (2001), The Sum of All Fears (2002), The Recruit (2003), I, Robot (2004), Lord of War (2005), Grey Matters (2006), Prey (2007), Noise (2007), Ramona and Beezus (2010), John Wick (2014), The Journey Home (2014), and John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017).\n\nShe starred in the ABC television series Six Degrees, which premiered in September 2006. However, it was taken off the schedule after just eight episodes aired. Since September 2010, Moynahan has starred as an assistant district attorney in the CBS drama Blue Bloods.\n\nKathryn Bridget Moynahan was born April 28, 1971, in Binghamton, New York.[1][2] She is the daughter of Irish Americans Mary Bridget (n\u00e9e Moriarty), a former school teacher, and Edward Bradley Moynahan, a scientist and former administrator at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.[3] Moynahan has an older brother, Andy, and a younger brother, Sean, who work as a computer programmer and potter, respectively.[4] When Moynahan was around seven years old, her family moved to Longmeadow, Massachusetts,[3] where she later attended Longmeadow High School, and was captain of the girls' soccer, basketball, and lacrosse teams,[5] graduating in 1989.[6] She has said that during her childhood, she was a \"tomboy\"\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Moynahan pursued a modeling career despite admitting she had never read fashion magazines growing up.[7] She had accompanied a friend to a modeling audition in Springfield, Massachusetts,[4] and was signed by the modeling agency instead of her friend.[7] She began her career appearing in department-store catalogs in Springfield, during which time she attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\n\nMoynahan moved to New York City at age 18, and a year later, began appearing in magazines such as Vogue and Elle, and on covers of other widely known magazines.[8] Her cover highlights include Vogue Paris (May 1993), Elle (October 1993), and Glamour (six times).[9] Discussing her early work in an interview given in July 2004, Moynahan said, \"It was a crazy world that paid a lot of money. I liked being a model, but I knew it would never last, so I looked into acting.\"[3]\n\nDuring that time, she began doing soap and shampoo commercials,[10] in addition to taking acting and art classes. She studied acting at the Caymichael Patten Studio in New York,[8] and in 1999, made her TV debut as Natasha in HBO's romantic comedy Sex and the City.[11] She later had a recurring role in the show, until the divorce of her character from Mr. Big (Chris Noth).[12] The following year, she appeared in smaller film roles, including having parts in In the Weeds and Whipped.\n\nMoynahan made her feature-film debut in the 2000 comedy-drama Coyote Ugly as Rachel, a bartender and dancer in a wild New York bar,[13] a role considered Moynahan's breakthrough.[14] She accepted the role because she \"thought it was interesting that the whole movie revolved around five women\u2026and my character was so strong and independent.\"[11] The film garnered generally unfavorable critical reviews,[15] but was a box-office success, earning $133 million worldwide.[16] Her next role was a supporting role in 2001 film Serendipity as Hally, the fianc\u00e9e of John Cusack's character.[17]\n\nMoynahan worked opposite Ben Affleck and Morgan Freeman in the action film The Sum of All Fears, based on Tom Clancy's book of the same name.[18] Moynahan plays Dr. Catherine Muller, a love interest for Affleck's Jack Ryan.[19] Dave Larsen of the Dayton Daily News reported the subplot involving Moynahan and Affleck was \"the film's weakest point\".[20] The Sum of All Fears received ambivalent reviews,[21] but was a commercial success, earning $193 million at the box office.[22] Her next role was as a CIA trainee in The Recruit (2003).[23] The movie was poorly received,[24] with Mike Clark of USA Today commenting The Recruit is \"less-than-middling melodrama whose subject matter and talent never click as much as its credits portend\"."}

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "24-11-2012: I OWE OBAMA AND EVERYONE AN APOLOGY Yes, I was taken in by the propaganda against Obama, believing a lie circulated about how many executive orders he has signed compared to other presidents. When I was told that it wasn't true that he had signed more than all previous presidents combined, I did not believe it. I had seen it repeated again and again on the Internet; it had to be true. Yet when I got home and checked the federal register of the national archives, I was stunned. It wasn't even close. Even JFK and Gerald Ford had signed more than Obama has so far, and that was less than three years in each case. How much of what we believe is true falls into the same category as this - only propaganda? No matter how many times we may repeat a lie, it will never make it the truth. I'm truly sorry, not only that I was taken in by this, but that I had repeated it several times in my videos in which my intent has always been to tell the truth."}

Of course, this was all in jest, but it piqued the public's interest. However, the conversation took a fascinating turn when Obama became more serious and discussed UFOs. He revealed that there are indeed documented sightings and records of objects in the sky that remain a mystery.

Five years later, a new group of co-eds converges near Camp Crystal Lake, scene of the original massacre and the drowning of Jason Vorhees that preceded it. This time around, the horny collegians attend a nearby training school for camp counselors. As half the group parties in town, an unseen assailant picks off the other half one by one. Only when camp leader Paul (John Furey) and his girlfriend, Ginny (Amy Steel), return to camp do they uncover the identity of their stalker -- none other than Jason (Warrington Gillette) himself, alive but grotesquely deformed as a result of his childhood drowning. Flashbacks chronicle Jason's behind-the-scenes activities in the first film (perhaps explaining how his mother was able to throw the dead bodies of muscular youths through windows with such apparent ease). The young couple's only hope to defeat the fiend lies in psych major Ginny's insights in Jason's mental state.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \u00a9 Paramount (1981)\nCast: Marta Kober, Bill Randolph\nDirector: Steve Miner\nProducers: Lisa Barsamian, Tom Gruenberg, Frank Mancuso Jr., Steve Miner, Dennis Stuart Murphy\nScreenwriters: Ron Kurz, Victor Miller\n\nWHO ARE WE?\nThe MOVIECLIPS channel is the largest collection of licensed movie clips on the web.

The origin of these enigmatic continent-sized formations has intrigued and confused geologists for four decades. Some specialists believe that the enormous rocks are remnants of tectonic plates that were buried under their counterparts and are now stuck. However, new studies suggest that their origin might be extraterrestrial. A planet named Theia collided with the proto-Earth 4.5 billion years ago, and the result was the creation of our favorite satellite, the Moon.

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "The sad life and tragic end of actor Kelsey Grammer. The sad life and tragic end of actor Kelsey Grammer.\n\n\n#kelseygrammer \n\nAllen Kelsey Grammer (born February 21, 1955) is an American actor, comedian and producer. For two decades, Grammer played psychiatrist Dr. Frasier Crane on the NBC sitcom Cheers and its spin-off Frasier, winning four Primetime Emmy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards for the role. His other roles include the political drama series Boss for which he won a Golden Globe Award, the period drama series The Last Tycoon, and a recurring guest role as the voice of Sideshow Bob in The Simpsons, with additional voice roles in Anastasia (1997) and Toy Story 2 (1999). He has also appeared in various television shows such as 30 Rock, Modern Family, and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.\n\nGrammer is also known for his work in theatre, acting alongside Christopher Plummer and James Earl Jones in Othello, and Macbeth on Broadway.[3] In 1983, he starred alongside Mandy Patinkin in Stephen Sondheim's Sunday in the Park with George at Playwrights Horizons, Off-Broadway. He has also starred in productions of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street playing the title character, and My Fair Lady as Professor Henry Higgins. In 2010, he received his first Tony Award nomination for his performance in La Cage aux Folles.[4] In 2016, Grammer won a Tony Award as a producer of The Color Purple. In 2019, he starred as Don Quixote in a production of Man of La Mancha at the London Coliseum. In the course of his career in television Grammer has won five Primetime Emmy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, one Daytime Emmy Award and one Tony Award. Additionally, he has also worked as a television producer, director, and writer.\n\nAllen Kelsey Grammer was born on February 21, 1955, in Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands,[2][1] the son of Sally (n\u00e9e Cranmer; 1928\u20132008),[5][6] a singer and actress, and Frank Allen Grammer Jr. (d. 1968),[5] a musician and owner of a coffee shop and a bar and grill called Greer's Place.[7][8] He had one younger sister, Karen, and four half-siblings from his father's second marriage.\n\nGrammer's personal life has been surrounded by family tragedies. He was raised by his mother and maternal grandparents, Gordon and Evangeline Cranmer, in New Jersey.[9] The family later moved to Pompano Beach, Florida, and shortly afterwards, when Kelsey was twelve years old, his grandfather died of cancer.[9] In 1968, his father was murdered by an \u201canti-white\u201d cab driver during a wave of racial violence following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.[10][11][12] In 1975, his sister was kidnapped, raped, and murdered in Colorado Springs.[13] In 1980, his two teenage half-brothers died in a scuba diving accident.[14]\n\nGrammer attended Pine Crest School, a private preparatory school in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.[9] It was there that he first began to sing and perform on stage.[9] Grammer won a scholarship to study drama at the Juilliard School.[9] He was a member of Group 6 from 1973 to 1975.[15] Owing to his sister's murder, however, Grammer failed to attend classes and was eventually expelled.[9] According to his interview with the Cayman Compass in 2019, Grammer described himself as \"a Caribbean kid\" who \"was born in St. Thomas, USVI, and I have been back and forth a lot, gone to the Bahamas a lot, St. John and the Virgin Islands and the BVI.\"\n\nGrammer has been married four times and has seven children and one grandchild as of 2011.[34] His first marriage, to dance instructor Doreen Alderman,[35] lasted from 1982 to 1990, although they were separated for the last six years of that period.[36] They have one daughter, actress Spencer Grammer (born October 9, 1983).[37] Through Spencer, Grammer has one grandson, Emmett Emmanual Hesketh (born October 10, 2011).[35]\n\nAfter his divorce from Alderman, Grammer had a daughter, Kandace Greer Grammer (\"Greer Grammer\"; born February 15, 1992), with hair and makeup stylist Barrie Buckner. Greer was a cast member on MTV's show Awkward."}

It helped me to become more self aware with my surroundings and it saved me lots of money dating these quote unquote\"women\", now I'm using it for smarter choices like supporting your channel. My topic is: The single life of a man vs a woman (their lifestyle, education, finance, happiness). P.S. F society.\" Well Luis thanks for the donation and your topic request. You know I can take this video in many different directions but I'll try and do a general overview with regards to the differences in lifestyle between a bachelor and bachlorette. First of all we all know that for men the life of a bachelor is far easier financially. I find that men generally are able to save more money and have better impulse control when it comes to our spending. So most of the single bachelors that I know either have a good sized emergency fund and they spend way below their means. Some guys I know bank almost eighty to ninety percent of their net earnings and live with the parents and in a city like Toronto they still can't afford to buy an apartment or house for cash money even after fifteen to twenty years of saving. Most single women move out with roommates in their twenties around here or they stretch their finances and get their own apartment and after renting for ten or twenty years don't have dime to their name. The single lady has to project the status of being independent so that she's a chameleon trying to attract a similar man into her life. Then there are also women single women around here that own their own tiny apartments and have a cat or a dog. Overall I find that the majority of single women have an animal of some kind to keep them company especially if they are in their thirties. Most of the single guys I know don't really get pets because it's yet another responsibility. So that's one major difference between single men and women. The women tend to have more animals. As for education lately we've been hearing that two thirds of university and college students are women in North America. Women don't have a problem getting into debt for school and they tend to take on more debt and it takes them longer to pay it back. Recently there have been all kinds of articles and videos saying that there's a student loan gap. The problem is women want the status of a diploma and education and have no issues taking on debt but when it comes time to pay it back they use the myth of the wage gap to tell everyone how life isn't fair. They stop short of everything but asking the banks and the government to bail them out and pay their debts off. Red Pill Germany was telling me that the situation has been getting so bad for single American women that they become expats in Germany to avoid paying back their loans. If they don't have a job for ten years or something similar than they don't have to pay the money back. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com.

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "Gender Neutral Bathrooms - MGTOW I want to talk about new trend where Canadian high schools and universities are creating gender neutral bathrooms and by default going to eventually ban male urinals. The first link in the description is from one of my earlier videos talking about how European countries, most notably Sweden have been trying to ban male urinals. But I honestly think the real push to get rid of them will be using first the excuse of trans gendered children wanting their own single use gender neutral bathrooms and then schools will eventually take things even further. Gender neutral bathrooms have been put into many public schools in cities like Ottawa, Vancouver, an Edmonton Catholic high school as well as Toronto. But now they are taking things to the next level. They are creating larger all-gender washrooms in Toronto. The second link in the \ndescription below is to an article called: \"No More Women\u2019s Rooms: Why Bathrooms Should All Be Gender-Neutral.\" Here's a quote as to why they are a bad idea, or good idea based on your perspective. \"women with histories of sexual assault or rape will be made uncomfortable by the presence of men in the bathroom, especially if there\u2019s any possibility of seeing a penis at the urinals; men will not feel comfortable using the urinals with women in the room or having to urinate sitting down in the absence of urinals. People often have a visceral oh hell no reaction to the concept of allowing people of any gender to use any public restroom. But from a queer perspective, most of these arguments are questionable.\" The foremost reason for being anti-bathroom-neutralization involves the sensitive issue of sexual assault. Many people who believe gender-neutral bathrooms would benefit society in both providing for the needs of trans* people and helping to alleviate severe separations between the genders don\u2019t want to be insensitive to the needs of sexual assault survivors. So there you have it folks the real reason this is an issue up for debate is because no one wants to offend either the women that may or may not have been sexually assaulted or the trans people that want to be included in the community. But what about men. Yes it's mentioned that men will feel uncomfortable if women check out\ntheir weenies at the stall. So I predict that to quote unquote satisfy men from being stared at by women the urinals will be removed for men's benefit as well as the so called benefit of women that were victims of assault. Because god knows if a woman sees a flaccid penis she could have a Vietnam style flashback in the middle of the washroom. \n\n\n\n\nBanning Male Urinals\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr59wELgFDo\n\nGender-neutral bathrooms coming to Ottawa schools\nhttp://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/gender-neutral-bathrooms-coming-to-ottawa-schools-1.2514473\n\nNo More Women\u2019s Rooms: Why Bathrooms Should All Be Gender-Neutral\nhttp://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2013/12/26/gender_neutral_bathrooms_all_bathrooms_should_be_open_to_all_users.html\n\nStar Trek STNG Moments 43 Samaritan Snare\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeFoGo3N_4g\n\n\n\n\n\n10 pictures paid for and licensed through BigStock.com (In order of appearance)\n\n\n1.

Since 2019, he has starred as Bumpy Johnson in the Epix crime drama series Godfather of Harlem.\n\nApart from his acting career, Whitaker is also known for his humanitarian work and activism. In 2011, he was inducted as a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador, later receiving a promotion to Special Envoy for Peace and Reconciliation, and serves as the CEO of Whitaker Peace and Development Initiative (WPDI), a non-profit outreach program.\n\nForest Steven Whitaker was born on July 15, 1961, in Longview, Texas,[5] the son of Laura Francis (n\u00e9e Smith), a special education teacher who put herself through college and earned two master's degrees while raising her children, and Forest E. Whitaker Jr., an insurance salesman.[6][7] A DNA test has shown that his mother had Akan ancestry, while his father was of Igbo descent.[8] When Whitaker was in elementary school, his family moved to Carson, California.[9] He has two younger brothers and an older sister. His first role as an actor was the lead in Dylan Thomas's play Under Milk Wood.[9]\n\nWhitaker attended Palisades Charter High School, where he played on the football team and sang in the choir, graduating in 1979. He entered California State Polytechnic University, Pomona on a football scholarship,[10] but a back injury made him change his major to music (singing). He toured England with the Cal Poly Chamber Singers in 1980. While still at Cal Poly, he briefly changed his major to drama. He later transferred to the Thornton School of Music at the University of Southern California to study opera as a tenor and was subsequently accepted into the university's Drama Conservatory.[7] He graduated from USC with a BFA in acting in 1982.[11] He was pursuing a degree in \"The Core of Conflict: Studies in Peace and Reconciliation\" at New York University's Gallatin School of Individualized Study in 2004.\n\nIn 1996, Whitaker married actress Keisha Nash, whom he met on the set of Blown Away.[2] They have four children: two daughters together (Sonnet and True), and his son (Ocean Alexander) and her daughter (Autumn) from their previous relationships. In December 2018, Whitaker filed for divorce from Nash, citing irreconcilable differences.[105]\n\nWhitaker studies yoga, has a black belt in kenp\u014d and is a vegetarian.[2] He also trains in eskrima, originally under Dan Inosanto and currently with Joe Jackson. In 2021, it was announced that he had joined NBA Africa as a minority owner and strategic investor.[106]\n\nWhitaker's left eye ptosis has been called \"intriguing\" by the critic Susan Wloszczyna,[107] with the writer Stephanie Zacharek maintaining that it gives him \"a sleepy, contemplative look\".[108] Whitaker has explained that the condition is hereditary and that he has considered having surgery to correct it, not for cosmetic reasons but because it affects his vision.[109]\n\nHis ancestry has been traced to Nkwerre in Imo State of Nigeria, where he was made an honorary titled chief on April 5, 2009."}

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "WGTOW vs MGTOW The last few weeks I've been getting messages from a few women. The first one is a a troll named Samantha that's been creating very short so called WGTOW videos trying to get attention. She even had the nerve to contact me and here's what she has to say and I quote: \"Hi Sandman, I have not messaged you before, but I want you to know I think you do good for this community. When I first discovered your videos I thought I should prove that I wasn't like that and proceeded to dive into a thread trying to prove I was a nawalt, which now I realize after being here for a while now, is not possible. You are awesome and I hope your channel goes on to good things which I am sure it will. Good luck honey with your channel, you deserve it, but also... don't read too much into things.\" So those are the words of WGTOW Samantha and the first link in the description is for her YouTube channel. So Samantha complimented me on my channel, no doubt to boost my ego and then she told me not to read too much into what she has to say because she's using reverse psychology to try and get a response from me. She also says that she's just like all the other women out there to make me feel confident and confirm my suspicions about female nature. She's done everything short of put on lingerie and ask me to join her in her bedroom. Although she does have a sexy Irish accent I just don't get it on with trolls. Sorry honey. In all honestly I think Samantha is going to get tired and bored of making her record breaking six second long videos and mosey off to better pastures. The second link in the description is to a slightly longer video called simply WGTOW by a YouTuber known as Atheist Elanor. And she opens her video by saying that women should cut themselves off from men because men are hypergamous and not women. To be fair to Elanor the definition of hypergamy is \"The action of marrying a person of a superior caste or class.\" And in a way that's true because women have far more rights, get more attention and by most of society they are considered superior because they are treated that way. That superior treatment comes from having a golden vagina. So I have to handed it to Elanor she got it right by saying that men are hypergamous. She says that men go for the women with the biggest breasts and ass to elevate their social status. Which again is right. Most guys, but not all seek to get the best woman they can based on their assets and status. But unlike the fact that we know that all women are like that we have to differentiate that not all men are like that. Some men such as myself valued loyalty and a drama free existence instead of having eye candy on my arm. That's what I did for fifteen to twenty years of my life. I was happy to be with a woman that society would have considered lower status then myself and in the end it didn't matter because I was still disrespected. Atheist Elanor goes on to say that men can be replaced with vibrators and teddy bears obviously taking a jab at the idea that men want to create sex dolls to replace women. \n\n\n\n\nwgtow Samantha\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfR5OFj0i4uLdi_gOC5GbqA\n\nWGTOW\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrfzfRO2H3U\n\n\n\n\n\n9 pictures paid for and licensed through BigStock.com (In order of appearance)\n\n1. prometeus - Beautiful young woman posing on a road over picturesque landscape.\nhttp://www.bigstockphoto.com/image-38750920/stock-photo-beautiful-young-woman-posing-on-a-road-over-picturesque-landscape\n\n2. sakkmesterke - Sexy Woman With Usa Flag\nhttp://www.bigstockphoto.com/image-121066778/stock-photo-sexy-woman-with-usa-flag\n\n3. brickrena - Silhouette of Young Woman at Urban Sunset\nhttp://www.bigstockphoto.com/image-70895965/stock-photo-silhouette-of-young-woman-at-urban-sunset\n\n4. monkeybusinessimages - Three Women Posing Outdoors\nhttp://www.bigstockphoto.com/image-3917889/stock-photo-three-women-posing-outdoors\n\n5. dolgachov - people, patriotism, national pride and independence day concept\nhttp://www.bigstockphoto.com/image-93189203/stock-photo-people%2C-patriotism%2C-national-pride-and-independence-day-concept-happy-teenage-girl-in-shades-with-american-flag\n\n6.

So, over the past few days I had a few people direct the phrase to me, \"Well, now it is time for the real world.\" \n\nEntering into the \u201creal world\u201d as it is always said to soon to be college graduates is a phrase that carries unending negative connotations with it. It is associated with the end of one\u2019s life essentially. It\u2019s a throwaway line, but it is a line that often is associate with the decision for some to throw away their life. Today I\u2019m going to throw away this throwaway line that actually causes you to throw away your life that isn\u2019t actually real, but is fake instead. Entering into the fake world.\n\nI would equate it to this line, lines that are said out of a sad desperation but beneath the half-hearted chuckle lies a red pill truth: \u201cThere goes the rest of your life as you know it.\u201d It\u2019s a line that I heard when I was with one of my college teammates at the bar the other day. One of the employees there revealed that they were going to have a child. His coworker, a female, delivered that line, and since going MGTOW, I\u2019ve now realized what this actually means - on the outside, it appears and is delivered like it is a joke. But, in reality, it\u2019s laced with a red pill reality. \n\nThe real world is something one doesn't have to enter into. Furthermore, the real world can be opted into, only to be left as soon as possible. \n\nLastly, the real world is an option for many only because they've bought into the red pill paradigm. \n\n#hoodiesup"}

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "Once You Go Black - MGTOW Once You Go Black - MGTOW\n\n\nSponsor Link:\nAlternative Investments\nhttp://www.Alternativeinvesting.club\n\nMGTOW Mystery Link: https://youtu.be/u-vSB6gQszY?t=1034\n\nHi Everyone Sandman Here,\n\nThis video is brought to you by a donation from Mark and here's what he has to say: \"Hi Sandman, Maybe mull this one over. \u2019Sometimes\u2019 American men, assuming mostly middle class, white men travel for sex and marriage to the orient and latin America. Hoping to find a woman that is not \u2019typical\u2019 woman that MGTOW men try to avoid. My question is, as a reaction to that, have American women again assuming mostly white middle class again been migrating toward interracial \u2018experimentation\u2019 in the same way American men have. What are the women\u2019s destinations? (I hear of western women sex tourism to Africa and the Caribbean \u2018black', more than latin America, or Asia\u2026) Possible pointing to American women desiring \u201cbad boy\u201d types to fill their desires/void? Interracial adult entertainment is big business, is it a real trend for white anglo-saxen women or just imagined fantasy? Also, are men or women being fooled by the direction adult content points to? My point is American men seem to want docile, obedient loving women, and American women? If my guess is correct want to gravitate toward more DOMINANT, demanding men. Exposing a woman to her \u201cTRUTH\u201d is always amusing, as they never want to face or admit it. Thus MGTOW, confused men, trying to out guess a woman. I hope I came across well, its a complex, but simple theory/analysis. In closing, my favorite Al Bundy quote \u201cDon\u2019t try to understand women, women understand women, and they hate each other.\u201d Great job on your MGTOW presentations. One last thought. How can men support each other, like a \u2018big brother\u2019 reaching a supportive hand up\u2026? I went through a terrible divorce and it cost over half a million dollars in lawyer fees. I know many of the tricks and pitfalls. I'm thinking about putting something together as a \u2018pre-emptive\u2019 prophylactic against the mine field that men enter, with no real guidance, or rule book.\" Well Mark thanks for the donation and topic and yes writing a rule book to help men navigate the mine field of the divorce courts is a great idea. When you write it I'd be willing to promote it on my channel through some sort of a sponsorship. Speaking of sponsors let me tell you about the one sponsoring todays video, Alternative Investments: Anyways, now back to my response to Mark and he wants to know why western women are going to the Carribean and Africa for sex tourism and to find partners in those countries. As well as how this relates to men that go to Asia to find women over there. I think it comes down to the fact that in the west men are increasingly being feminized while women are being masculinized. Since opposites attract if you're a feminine western woman or masculine western man your ability to find a partner that doesn't disgust you has gone down. So it makes sense that men are moving to Asian countries to find women that are feminine. Plus remember that in a place like Thailand there are very few overweight women. Even the ladyboys look better than western women. That should tell you all you need to know. Even a somewhat feminized man from the west will probably look more masculine than many of the Asian men over there so women will find such men attractive. Plus add their financial status and resources and it's easy to see why men are going to places like that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com.

However, using current technology, it would take a person about 6,000 years to travel there. Of course this is far too long, so scientists at NASAA knew that in order to achieve this we need to develop a new method of interstellar space travel in order to traverse the vast distances between Alpha Centauri, other exoplanets, and our own Solar System. Could we reasonably expect to go to any of the nearby stars? How does NASA plan on getting to these faraway planets?

For one, it\u2019s much smaller than anything else revolving around our star. Did you know that Pluto is only 1,400 miles wide? That means that it\u2019s only half the width of the United States of America. Secondly, Pluto is further away from the Sun and, partly because of that, is covered with a lot of ice. Ices like methane and nitrogen frost coat the surface of this tiny, unique little world.

But while it is now categorized as a dwarf planet, it is still one of the most interesting objects we have come across. And it\u2019s just gotten a lot more interesting.

From her famous walk, through her iconic make up, to the energy that still startles people all over the world. No-one could understand the powerful energy they were able to experience not only in real life, but years and decades later even though the screen. And in this video, we will dive into the greatest secret behind the Maryline Monroe phenomenon. \n\nWho was Maryline Monroe? Her real name was Norma Jean. She was born on June 1 in 1926. Imagine a little girl, who has spent her youngest years in 12 foster homes, molested, abandoned and completely failed by the closest people she ever loved and needed. Imagine how broken and unloved she had to feel. This was the childchool of Norma Jeans. Now compare this picture with what she was able to make of herself. What a work of art she was able to create and become. Even though her childhood was very sad, she always saw the brighter side of things\n\nHer biggest secret no-one knew is that, she was actually self invented and self created. She has created a piece of art and then, she become it. She is the mixture of all the women she has every admired, as an orphan she is the daughter all all the feminine energy women she admired. She cut and added to herself the pieces of other women who ever inspired her. She was the scrap book of all the best women who ever walked on this planed. She was self invented and believe me you too, can invent yourself. But lets start at the beginning.\nNorma Jean was a dreamer and a shy and self conscious girl. However, soon in life she realised the power her body had on the male gaze.\nShe wrote in her diary  \u201c they stared at me as it was a goldmine\u201d.\nPreviously ignored and ridiculed girl, she has realise the power she had. She started to smile more, wear make up and started to realise  something- boys fell passionately in love with her. \n\u201c They say, that I gave off vibrations that fuel them\u201d. \nIn her earlier career, the  movie directors told her that her body was good, but her face was not beautiful enough to play in the movies. They didn\u2019t see any star quality in her. Now lets make a little digression here. Imagine If she took those worlds, went home and blieved that she is not good enough. If she gave up like that, we would never meet the Maryline Monroe phenomenon that we know of today. Because dear ladies \u201c Winners never quit, and quitters never win\u201d...."}

His wife monkey branched to his best friend just before he was about to retire. She then filed for divorce and expelled him from his home and attempted to cut him off from all contact with his children. To make matters even worse, his mother-in-law attempted to replace him as the \"father\" of his young children. He got all this news right before Christmas of last year, just in time for the holidays. The torrent of mental abuse he received from his wife and mother-in-law pushed him over the edge and, through a series of unfortunate events, let to him being shot by the police after a failed suicide attempt. He survived. However, as the holiday season draws near, I fear for him and his mental stability. He is a good guy, and never deserved any of this. The large-scale victimization of men by women is very real. I have experienced it personally, and I have seen it happen to many other men. Thank you, Sandman, for educating men about female nature: the single greatest threat to their happiness and well-being that they are ever likely to face during their lives. By the way, Sandman, I have a question and a request for you. I have several young nephews in their early 20s who are kind, intelligent, financially successful, and attractive. This makes them the perfect prey for predatory females. I want to warn them about female nature, but don't know how to approach this topic with them. How would you do it? Could you consider making a video containing this advice? Many thanks.?\" Although I think you may have just answered my request with your video for teenage boys! This Xmas, I am going to refer my young nephews to your channel and I truly hope they will listen to what you have to say, because it could literally save them from a lifetime of regrets and losses. Perhaps after what happened last Xmas, they will listen. What a nightmare. As for myself, if I could have heard and acted on the knowledge contained in your educational videos when I was young, I could have avoided the vast majority of pain, suffering, and financial losses that I have incurred during my life. You are really making a difference!\" Well Marvin thanks for the donation and topic. I'm glad I've already answered the part of your question where you want to know how to talk to your nephews about female nature and being\ntaken advantage of the predatory female. I can generalise female nature by saying that famous line from the film Fight Club where Tyler Durden says that she's a predator posing as a house pet. A good predator will use camoflouge and stealth so that you don't see them coming. The female chameleon hides by wrapping herself in the same interests as you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com. All image licenses are available upon request."}

{"label": "harmless", "sentence": "When Lions Fight for the Throne - Dean Schneider It has been a minute since You've heard from me or received an update from the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis. A lot happened over the past months and years and it has been a bumpy road not only for Me but also for some of the Animals. We all knew Leo was after the throne but we also saw the unconditional love between all the lions within the pride. Time showed that a Lion has no other choice then just naturally be a Lion and reach for the highest stars and with that the best possible position in a pride. Even though they are brothers and don't want to kill one another as true Lions they are all prepared to hurt and get hurt for a higher position in the pride.  Such ranking fights can result in major injuries which is the reason we did split them for now and the near future. Being able to move the first lions next months into the Live Wild Area might also change the perspective for their future constellation again. For now they are all happy and healthy with the current constellation. I'm excited to see what the future holds for the Lions, it's definitely going to be an interesting, enlightening and enriching process.\n\nStay tuned for more!\n\nMuch love from the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis to all of You amazing supporters out there.\n\nPS: ''SUPER THANKS'' are mostly appreciated as a support for the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis.\n\n\nVIDEOTITLE\nSubscribe:  http://bit.ly/subDeanSchneider | Follow my IG: https://www.instagram.com/dean.schneider \n \nVIDEO SPECIFIC INFO HERE\n \nFollow Dean Schneider:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/schneiderdean/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dean.schneider \nTiktok: https://tikitoks.com/@deanschneider.official \n \nOfficial Website: https://www.deanschneider.com/ \n\nSupport Hakuna Mipaka Oasis: https://www.deanschneider.com/donation/donate-now/\n \nAbout Dean Schneider: \nI am a 28-year old Swiss guy, who dedicated his entire life to the animal world! Nowadays, I live in Africa, I am a member of a lion pride, my wife is a hyena and I\u2019m a daddy of two monkeys. Besides that, I have built a global voice for our planet\u2019s wildlife over the past two years!\n\nBorn in Switzerland (Zurich) on October 3, 1992, I was blessed to grow up in a loving family with my sister (one year older) and my parents, who were always very supportive and loving. My mother is originally from the Balkan region (Southeastern Europe), while my dad is a Swiss citizen. I discovered my deep passion for wildlife at the age of six or seven, through the legendary Steve Irwin! He was the one who brought wildlife into my living room in Zurich and inspired and educated me about all kinds of different animal species.\n\nEven though I was so passionate about animals, I originally followed a very ordinary path to adulthood, eventually ending up in the finance industry as a financial advisor. After a very successful year, I decided to found my own company, which then, over the next three years, allowed me to generate the financial foundation to launch the Hakuna Mipaka project at the age of 23-24.\n\nAfter starting my life in South Africa additional financial support form my Family allowed me to evolve and develop the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis for 2 Years without having to depend on any income sources such as offering touristic visits / programs, breeding or trading of animals, donations or any other monetary businesses! \n\nAbout Hakuna Mipaka:\nThe Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is located on around 400 hectares (four million square meters) in the wilderness of South Africa! It is home to thousands of different wild animal species! Besides that, the oasis also serves as a life-long home to a few rescued wild animals, which were born in captivity! We also do rehabilitation programs with different animals, which are then being released back into the wild.\n\nThe Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is my personal home and a private sanctuary that is NOT open to the public. We don\u2019t cater to tourists and don\u2019t allow any day visits or animal activities! We don\u2019t breed animals and we are also not trading animals. I built this place for animals and not for humans. The Hakuna Mipaka oasis is a secure, wild & lifelong home to the animals that live here.\n\n#DeanSchneider #lion  #africa"}

So they have to consult their inner woman to have a more harmonious way of thinking which will lead to wiser and better decisions.

You said 24-29 years old is the hardest time for a man. I would qualify that as \u201cnowadays\u201d. That period just after gaining a sense of independence is the hardest. You\u2019re still seen as a cute little kid while inside you feel like you\u2019re ready to conquer the world. Adults, especially parents, offer advice as coaching (so as long as you are dealing with the right adults), but young men (and women) often see it as an older person trying to control them (and sometimes it is). \n\nThe most important thing I see as a takeaway from the MGTOW movement is that it\u2019s a visceral reaction to culture that\u2019s gone all wrong with regards to sexuality, family and many other categories I don\u2019t have time to get into. It\u2019s a movement to get young men (and maybe some older) to grow up in ways we didn\u2019t when we were younger because of a society bent on defeating all forms of masculinity as a knee-jerk reaction to the bullying and improper male dominance that\u2019s pervaded in some corners (and which receives far too much attention). \n\nKeep up the good work. Don\u2019t overdo the MGTOW thing -- unless you\u2019re actually called like Paul -- or you could miss out on a unicorn (they exist, btw. In very few numbers, but they exist. And you\u2019re very likely not going to meet any in the States! Haven\u2019t met one American woman who is. The only one I know was raised by a missionary couple in Mexico. But, she\u2019s taken. Not by me. And I don\u2019t wish it otherwise because I love their family and she\u2019s wonderful for him). MGTOW has the potential to coddle cynical attitudes of guys who (think) they could never be married, have kids and be a proper husband and father. Guard against that. MGTOW should be a call to empowerment and maturity -- not isolation.\n\nAs for schooling; I recommend higher education, but I also strongly encourage independent study. I think schools should be teaching financial intelligence as well. Young people 16 and older should take accounting and budgeting classes. Those two things unlock worlds of understanding when it comes to business, economics and a host of other things. So stupid that schools don\u2019t teach anything but the ideals of economics rather than real world stuff. Same thing with government: schools teach the ideals, and not how governments really function (bribes, conspiracies, etc.)\n\nOkay, that\u2019s my rant for now. \n\n----------------------------\n\n...Thank you for the comment. My response is that the reasons that men go MGTOW are all across the board, but I know that for me, my reason is far more than avoiding marriage. It's a way of life that I've always wanted more. \n\n#hoodiesup"}

I had a client who is dating this women and he tells me she's very unpredictable. She goes up and down; one day she texts him and one day she doesn't. It frustrates him and it gets him very emotional. It makes him feel irrational. And so let's first talk about why women become unpredictable and how to deal with it.\n\nGenerally, women become unpredictable when they're not over somebody in their lives. They're with you but they're not over their ex. The next thing is that she might not be as interested in you and she might be giving you a trial or she might be dating a whole bunch of guys and she kind of likes you so she wants to keep you around. And so her unpredictable behaviour, in reality, is just that she has other options. She might like you but she might like other guys.\n\nSo how do you deal with this unpredictability? If you don't know how to deal with it, you could honestly end up resenting women. I'm not even kidding, that ends up happening.\n\nThe first thing's first: you have to expect it. You have to expect women to pull away. You have to expect women to act completely irrational. you have to expect women to do things that make no sense. It's important for you to expect that because it's in their nature. They can't help it. It's not something that they can control with themselves. Expect it so it doesn't catch you by surprise.\n\nThe second thing is to have a rational countermeasure. I mean consequences. If she takes a long time to text back, you do the same thing. If she cancels on a date, then you let her know that yu don't like that. You check her and get a little cold on her.\n\nThe point is that you gotta have almost like a policy of things you will do depending on how much disrespect she shows. You gotta have a policy because they're going to act in ways that make no sense and the reason sometimes they do that is to frustrate you and test you. You gotta show strength, remain centred and do not pursue a woman who's being irrational. All you gotta do is pull away until she calms down. Pay attention to her once she's acting the way you want her to act.\n\nRead more here: https://www.mindfulattraction.org/how-to-deal-with-womens-unpredictability/"}

With a tearful farewell, We have extremely sad news about 'Batman' Star Julie Newmar, Bye!\n\n#julienewmar\n\nJulie Newmar (born Julia Chalene Newmeyer, August 16, 1933) is an American actress, dancer, and singer, known for a variety of stage, screen, and television roles. She is also a writer, lingerie designer, and real-estate mogul. She won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play for her role as Katrin Sveg in the 1958 Broadway production of The Marriage-Go-Round and reprised the role in the 1961 film version. In the 1960s, she starred for two seasons as Catwoman in the television series Batman (1966\u20131967). Her other stage credits include the Ziegfeld Follies in 1956, Lola in Damn Yankees! in 1961, and Irma in Irma la Douce in 1965 in regional productions.\n\nNewmar appeared in the music video for George Michael's 1992 single \"Too Funky\" and had a cameo as herself in the 1995 film To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar. Her voice work includes the animated feature films Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders (2016) and Batman vs. Two-Face (2017), for which she reprised her role as Catwoman 50 years after the original television series.\n\nNewmar was born in Los Angeles, California on August 16, 1933,[3][4] as the eldest of three children born to Don and Helen (Jesmer) Newmeyer. Her father was head of the physical education department at Los Angeles City College and had played American football professionally in the 1920s with the 1926 Los Angeles Buccaneers of the National Football League. Her Swedish-French mother was a fashion designer who used Chalene as her professional name and later became a real-estate investor.[5]\n\nNewmar has two younger brothers, Peter Bruce Newmeyer (born 1935)[6] and John A. Newmeyer (born 1942), a writer, epidemiologist, and winemaker.[7][8] She began dancing at an early age, and performed as a prima ballerina with the Los Angeles Opera beginning at age 15.\n\nNewmar began appearing in bit parts and uncredited roles in films as a dancer, including a part as the \"dancer-assassin\" in Slaves of Babylon (1953) and the \"gilded girl\" in Serpent of the Nile (1953), in which she was clad in gold paint. She danced in several other films, including The Band Wagon (also 1953) and Demetrius and the Gladiators (1954). She also worked as a choreographer and dancer for Universal Studios beginning at age 19.[10][11] Her first major role, billed as Julie Newmeyer, was as Dorcas, one of the brides in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (also 1954). Her three-minute Broadway appearance as the leggy Stupefyin' Jones in the musical Li'l Abner in 1956 led to a reprise in the film version released in 1959. She was also the female lead in a low-budget comedy, The Rookie (also 1959).[12]\n\nNewmar had first appeared on Broadway in 1955 in Silk Stockings, which starred Hildegarde Neff and Don Ameche. She also appeared in the film, The Marriage-Go-Round (1961), which starred James Mason and Susan Hayward (Newmar had earlier developed the role of the Swedish vixen onstage and won a Tony Award for Best Supporting Actress for the Broadway version upon which the film was based). She later appeared on stage with Joel Grey in the national tour of Stop the World \u2013 I Want to Get Off and as Lola in Damn Yankees! and Irma in Irma La Douce.[12] and in Mackenna's Gold (1969).[13] She also appeared in a pictorial in the May 1968 issue of Playboy magazine, which featured Playmate Elizabeth Jordan.\n\nNewmar's fame stems mainly from her television appearances. Her statuesque form and height made her a larger-than-life sex symbol, most often cast as a temptress or Amazonian beauty, including an early appearance in sexy maid costume on The Phil Silvers Show. She starred as Rhoda the Robot on the television series My Living Doll (1964\u20131965), and is known for her recurring role on the 1960s television series Batman as the villainess Catwoman. (Lee Meriwether played Catwoman in the 1966 feature film and Eartha Kitt in the series' final season.) Newmar modified her Catwoman costume\u2014now in the Smithsonian Institution\u2014and placed the belt at the hips instead of the waist to emphasize her hourglass figure.[14]\n\nIn 1962, Newmar appeared twice as the motorcycle-riding, free-spirited heiress Vicki Russell on Route 66, filmed in Tucson (\"How Much a Pound Is Albatross\") and in Tennessee (\"Give the Old Cat a Tender Mouse\"). She guest-starred on The Twilight Zone as the devil in \"Of Late I Think of Cliffordville\", F Troop (\"Yellow Bird\" in 1966) as a girl kidnapped as a child and raised by Native Americans, Bewitched (\"The Eight-Year Itch Witch\" in 1971) as a cat named Ophelia given human form, The Beverly Hillbillies as a Swedish actress who stays with the Clampetts to learn their accents and mannerisms for a role, and Get Smart as a double agent assigned to Maxwell Smart's apartment posing as a maid. In 1967,"}

It would seem like we have conquered space travel, right? Wrong. \n\nEven though we have come a long way, there is still a lot to be achieved. And one area that can continually seek and achieve improvement is the vehicles used to fly through space.

The most important industries should always be trying to do better.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening now with the current slate of space vessels being built for interstellar travel. Certain companies are really blazing a new path when it comes to how we travel among the stars. Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin, and others like Virgin Galactic and Relativity Space are all making tremendous gains in the ways that ships are built and how they fly. Heck, Relativity is even creating their vessels with 3D printers. \n\nBut the next frontier of space travel might have to do with a subject that makes some people really uncomfortable: nuclear power. It\u2019s true, much like nuclear power has lit the homes of millions of people on Earth, it also has the chance to propel a new breed of rockets far beyond our planet\u2019s reach. The science behind it is so promising that the United States military is looking into nuclear-powered space travel. So what about this method is so incredible and worthwhile? And when will we see our first nuke-powered spaceship?\n\n\nSubscribe To Voyager \u27a1 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYYUGTG__Kc_4RBhv7FEolg/?sub_confirmation=1\n \nWATCH NEXT \ud83d\udc47\nElon Musk Reveals Plan To Colonize Mars \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXPj66c_dqA&list=PLaC8bl-mfsFf1SXQSFZkYDoTDa72-AvoD \n\nThumbnail Render:\nhttps://www.deviantart.com/paul-lloyd\n\n#Voyager #Nuclear #Pentagon #Space"}

Let's do a breakdown of the movie \"Wedding Crasher\". Some of you guys might know that you're with a psycho, but you guys don't care. The pleasure is too much. I 100% understand your dilemma but let's identify psychos and get rid of them.\n\nSomething about psychos is that they lurk in the background, they look normal and they take the initiatives. They take action so psychotic women have a higher level of confidence. They approach more, initiate contact more, they bring hope and then pull away.\n\nLook at people's actions and not just people's pretty faces. The first sign of crazy women is they look normal. It looks normal in the beginning like there's nothing to be afraid of or worried about but uh-uh boo boo. It's about to get real.\n\nThe second sign that a woman is a psycho is that she gets emotionally attached to you from the start. We all know that's what we want but we got to be specific when we wish something. You can't just wish a woman to love you, you got to make sure to wish a woman who's sane in the mind to love you. Having a crazy woman loving you is suffocating.\n\nWhen it comes to psychos, the way to identify psychos is having standards from the beginning, having boundaries and putting it. Nothing is even worse than when a psychotic woman sees you as a lower value.\n\nHere's a link to the article version: https://mindfulattraction.org/blog/2019/8/18/how-to-identify-amp-avoid-narcissistic-psychotic-women\n\nCheck out my course Dark Game so you\u2019ll learn all the techniques needed for you to attract women. https://dalexis-school.thinkific.com/courses/dark-game"}

Why It Is Working Like Instagram! And Become New Age Addiction for Youngsters! How Instagram Algorithm Works and How To Use Thread? for Business and Marketing. #instagram #threads #markzukerberg \n\nHow Thread Works with Instagram? Why Instagram is Connected With Thread? What is Mark Zukerberg's Plan for Thread. So Here is the Full Detailed Video on How Instagram's and Meta's New App Called Thread Works? and How to use it!\n\nChaiwala Sting Operation:\nhttps://youtu.be/WPSOhDQSWi4\n\nWatch More Analysis & Ideology Videos:\n15 Year Old Kids Making Crores! How?\nhttps://youtu.be/fH-6z4aJCXs\n\nUnique Youtube Channel Ideas:-\nhttps://youtu.be/gO5sBjO1pLg\n\nIn this video, we delve into the inner workings of Instagram's latest app feature: the Thread Algorithm. Instagram has introduced this algorithm to enhance user engagement and create a more personalized experience within the platform. Join us as we break down the key elements and functionality behind the Thread Algorithm.\n\nChapter:\n0:00 Why Thread Launched?\n1:28 Why It is Only Connected With Instagram?\n3:09 How Thread Algorithm Works?\n\nFirst, we explore how the Thread Algorithm categorizes and organizes content on your Instagram feed. By analyzing various factors such as user preferences, interests, and engagement history, Instagram's algorithm tailors the content shown to each individual user. We uncover the importance of relevance and how the algorithm prioritizes posts based on your interactions.\n\nNext, we shed light on the concept of threading, a fundamental aspect of the algorithm. Threads are formed when users engage with specific posts or profiles, indicating a deeper interest in those topics. The algorithm identifies these threads and curates content related to them, ensuring users are presented with a continuous stream of relevant posts, stories, and suggestions.\n\nFurthermore, we discuss the significance of user feedback in refining the Thread Algorithm. Instagram encourages users to provide feedback on the relevance and quality of the content they encounter. This feedback loop allows the algorithm to learn and adapt, constantly improving its ability to cater to individual preferences.\n\nWe also touch upon the role of influencers and creators in the Thread Algorithm. As creators play a pivotal role in shaping user experiences, the algorithm takes into account their relevance and popularity when suggesting content to users. We examine how influencers can optimize their posts to leverage the Thread Algorithm effectively and reach a wider audience.\n\nLastly, we address concerns surrounding privacy and data usage. While the Thread Algorithm relies on user data to deliver personalized content, Instagram emphasizes the protection of user privacy. We explore the measures taken by Instagram to ensure data security and offer tips for users to customize their privacy settings.\n\nIf you're curious about Instagram's new app Thread Algorithm and want to understand how it impacts your feed and overall experience, this video provides an insightful and comprehensive overview. Join us to unlock the secrets behind Instagram's latest innovation and make the most of your time on the platform.\n\nThings I used to Make Videos:-\n1.

Zack is a barista who doesn't make big tips, and Miri isn't exactly making top dollar either. Friends since grade school, they share a cramped apartment together, but the bills are piling up faster than their paychecks. Then, at their class reunion, the two friends meet up with a former classmate who's shot to success in the adult film industry. Inspired after a YouTube video of Miri in her granny panties goes viral, Zack and his roommate round up a crew and begin production on their masterpiece. When the time comes for Zack and Miri to shoot their first scene together, however, unexpected emotions start to bubble to the surface, prompting them both to wonder if they've somehow mistaken true love for mere friendship all these years.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \u00a9 The Weinstein Company (2008)\nCast: Elizabeth Banks, Seth Rogen, Craig Robinson, Katie Morgan, Jason Mewes, Traci Lords\nDirector: Kevin Smith\nProducers: Carla Gardini, Laura Greenlee, Scott Mosier, Bob Weinstein, Harvey Weinstein, Leslie Rodier\nScreenwriter: Kevin Smith\n\nWHO ARE WE?\nThe MOVIECLIPS channel is the largest collection of licensed movie clips on the web.

There is something that you could do that you\u2019re regarding as trivial, that you could do and if you would do it would result in an actual improvement...but you won\u2019t lower yourself enough to take the opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe doppelganger -- this is why it\u2019s so frightening\n\nI think that this is why I think that a doppelganger in literature, in any plot, is so frightening and often so grave. It\u2019s considered to be an omen of death, and Abraham Lincoln was said to remark that he used to see two of himself in the mirror. Mary Todd thought that he would be appointed for a second term. Rather, we know the ending, he was assassinated. \n\nMany cultures see the shadow as the external soul. If you don\u2019t have a shadow, you don\u2019t have a soul. Dracula doesn\u2019t have a reflection...thus\u2026.anyway. \n\nWeirdly, this conversation that Jordan Peterson had with Rogan and what he said about defeating your former self and becoming more prompted me to think about Dark Link, or Link\u2019s doppelganger. If you\u2019re not familiar with Link, LInk is the main protagonist in the game series, \u201cZelda\u201d. \n\nArguably the most memorable encounter in any of the games is between Link and Dark Link as they face off in an X-Files looking arena that is a massive reflective pool of water that appears to have a boundary that drifts off into infinity. \n\nIt\u2019s not the biggest juncture in the \u201cOcarina of Time\u201d title that I\u2019m mentioning, but it is regarded as oddly being the scariest or most unnerving encounter of any in the game. They both wear the same attire, albeit being different shades. They have the same moves and same style of fighting and it\u2019s loosely regarded as Link\u2019s greatest challenge. It\u2019s one of my favorite battles of all time as it\u2019s so unique, but I believe that it is so eerie because it\u2019s an examination of yourself and your weaknesses. It\u2019s the ultimate test, defeating yourself. In order to win you have to take advantage of your weaknesses. That\u2019s a very strange feeling while you\u2019re fighting - while you\u2019re fighting you\u2019re trying to win, but you\u2019re thinking about what you are not good at in order to win. Trying to stay focused while not crumbling is that challenge, but it exemplifies our challenge and I think that this is why this is one of the most memorable encounters in the game series and so meaningful for this message today. \n\nAnd as a result -- Navi -- who is the guide that goes along with Link in his adventures, says, \u201cConquer yourself.\u201d \n\nSo, in those two words, I think that\u2019s our endgame in MGTOW. Of course, it\u2019s a solitary end game. There\u2019s my answer. Conquering the self. Destroying the doppelganger. \n\n#hoodiesup"}

Thanks to businesses like SpaceX and Blue Origin, people all over the world are looking to the stars again and imagining a time in the very near future when we are shooting across the cosmos. Best of all, this newly-formed space age will be filled with civilians leaving our atmosphere. That is because one of the main goals of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and others is to provide a way for regular high-paying customers to accompany them into the stars. \n\nAmerica has mostly been on the forefront of these magnificent advancements in science and space exploration. But that doesn't mean that they will be the only names in the game. Russia is quickly staking a claim in this exciting new field, as is China. But what about England? Once home to the greatest explorers on the planet, is the United Kingdom thinking about competing with these other major nations and setting sail into the solar system beyond? Does the UK have what it takes to challenge SpaceX, its prized possession Starship, and the other countries around the world diving headfirst into space exploration? The answer is yes, Britain is definitely ready to enter the space race. And, based on the latest news, they are making up for the lost time. \n\nThumbnails Credit:\nTony Bela\nhttps://twitter.com/InfographicTony\n\nSubscribe Here \u27a1 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYYUGTG__Kc_4RBhv7FEolg/?sub_confirmation=1\n \nWATCH NEXT \ud83d\udc47\nElon Musk Reveals Plan To Colonize Mars \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXPj66c_dqA&list=PLaC8bl-mfsFf1SXQSFZkYDoTDa72-AvoD \n\n\n#Voyager #SpaceX #NASA"}

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "Single Mothers Make Me Sick - MGTOW \"Hello Sandman, this is Shaikh and I just wanted to share some updates about my friend DD with you. As you may recall from my last video request he went through a serious breakup in September of last year and was really emotionally messed up ever since. During the summer he was hanging out with a mutual friend of ours. Her name is Miss. M. and she's someone that DD and I have known for about 7 years now. She is also a single mom with two big kids. Apparently over the summer Miss M. and DD were hanging out together every single day as friends. Crazy right? This can tell you how emotionally broken and injured combined with emotional needy of another person he was. And during the same summer she broke up with her boyfriend and DD started falling for her head over heels in love. I gave him many reasons why he shouldn't pursue a single mother and initially he understood what I told him. But apparently DD was soooo emotionally screwed up and broken that despite the advice I gave him he eventually got into a relationship with her and still is. Every now and then he goes on Facebook where he is either expressing his dire love for M or praising her. And a significant number of his posts if not most are quite long. The frequency of such posts and the madness I see in his Facebook posts have proven to me how much he has lost his mind. It hurts to see this but this friend who I love as a brother has lost his marbles. In the past DD use to have significant amount of friction with his family now the tension between him and his family as a result of Miss. M being his girlfriend has greatly increased. So Sandman do you have any comments based on what I've told you so far. And thanks.\" Well Shaikh your friend DD has lost his mind even after you explained to him explicitly why he shouldn't date a single mother. Single mothers are bad news. I have gone a step further and I'm no longer taking any work from single mothers. One still owes me about fifty dollars for a video I shot with her daughter in it. Another one owes me a little bit more money for a website I designed. And the third one still hasn't paid me for a video I shot for her. All in all I'm out about three to four hundred dollars. I never get stiffed by men or women that are married or brides. But then again all three of these single mothers were regular clients. So it was only the last job they stiffed me on. And I've given my friends the same advice about dating single mothers. There's usually a good reason why most of them are single. I'll excuse the ones where their husbands died or the husband cheated on them or was cruel. But the majority of the time it's the women that dump the men and make a run for it. And then afterwards they expect to receive the same type of treatment from men as they did before they had kids. Recently someone was telling me about typical posts that they saw on dating sites from single women. Oh and by the way Shaikh believe it or not in almost seven hundred videos I've produced so far I haven't done a single one on Single Mothers.\n\n\n\n\nCougar Hunter: 31-year-old has 91-year-old Girlfriend\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omcxjXiWwpU\n\n\n\n\n\n10 pictures paid for and licensed through BigStock.com (In order of appearance)\n\n1. lolostock - Man With Eyes Painted On His Hands\nhttp://www.bigstockphoto.com/image-60463256/stock-photo-man-with-eyes-painted-on-his-hands\n\n2.

And now Phase 5 of the MCU will be rounded off by this rag-tag ensemble of villains in director Jake Schreier\u2019s Marvel's Thunderbolts movie.\n\nMarvel chief Kevin Feige has already teased that Thunderbolts will bring together an eclectic mix of familiar faces alongside new characters. And while it remains to be seen who will actually fill the roster of anti-heroes and villains, one can imagine the likes of Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), US Agent (Wyatt Russell), Baron Zemo (Daniel Br\u00fchl), and Abomination (Tim Roth) joining forces, among others.\u00a0\n\nAs with the Thunderbolts of Marvel\u2019s comics, fans and critics alike are already calling comparisons between the team and DC\u2019s Suicide Squad. The DC Extended Universe first brought the Suicide Squad to life in David Ayer\u2019s 2016 movie of the same name, followed by James Gunn\u2019s 2021 The Suicide Squad. The maligned cocktail of A-list stars and characters was far from perfect in those films, so here\u2019s hoping Schreier can avoid the same mistakes with Thunderbolts \u2013 and maybe channel some of their successes as well. With that in mind, here\u2019s what Thunderbolts can learn from the Suicide Squad movies.\n\n#IGN #Marvel"}

{"label": "harmful", "sentence": "Mangs' 4th \"Impossible Challenge\" destroyed by (not) Grimm Guy and his friend. (Risky Vale - Day 20) Let's see how Grimm Guy's new friend will beat a new \"impossible challenge\" from Mangs.\n\nSo, Jess vs Sturm and Kanbei, on Risky Vale again, but AW2 style. This one wasn't too hard to beat because of how awful the AI in this game is (plus, playing and finding low turn strats in Mangsvance Wars for now a year helped). RNG is almost a non-issue, outside maybe to get the 3rd Sturm's base. Other than that, it's pretty straightforward and, unless I missed something (though I didn't really test the RNG that much), I don't see this going too low for a perfect run. I know a few points at the end where I could have easily cut a day or two but the point was to complete it since there is way too much AI shenanigans to deal with in that many turns for me to post this quick enough. I'm looking forward to see that run happen though, I'm curious if my strat was close or not to what should be done for the run to be perfect.\n\nDisclaimer : This video was created only for entertainment reasons.

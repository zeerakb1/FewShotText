However, when we look at fishing jobs some of those captains make their annual income in the summer.  To be sure they put in long days.  I just find it ridiculous that we would effectively tax those of us who are eligible for the PFD without touching those that are not. \n\nI'll add that I have an Alaskan friend works a few weeks in Ohio most years.  That person pays tax to Ohio for their wages.  Likewise, when I was attending college out-of-state, I paid income tax on my work-study wages. That was for a pretty modest part-time wage and it didn't kill me. So if Alaskans can pay other states' income taxes when they do seasonal or short-term work elsewhere, we ought to collect from folks that do that sort of work here."}

Plato discussed it at length in his dialogue, Phaedo, in which he portrayed Socrates, as he prepared for his death, arguing that a real Philosopher should look forward to his own death because only then would he be free of the distorted knowledge that comes to us through the senses. His argument is that true knowledge cannot derive from the senses, which consistently deceive us and distort reality, but only through reason. Thus the birth of disciplines like mathematical physics, which substitutes the certainty of numbers and equations for the uncertainty of sense perception. Einstein could work out equations in his room and, if they proved right by experimentation, he could be certain that he knew something about the way the universe works (e.g., special relativity).

Finally, what would you propose re. the whole pre-existing conditions issue? Auto insurance differs from homeowners in a crucial way.

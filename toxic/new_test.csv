In response to some of the people who have commented-- Don't blame your personal grudges on immigration. It is a well researched fact that immigrants are the least likely to engage in criminal behavior. And think about this-- What would you do if the shoe was on the the other foot and you found yourself unable to exist in the country where you were born? Wouldn't you also do everything you could to get somewhere safe where you could work and feed yourself? Allowing immigration is ultimately beneficial to the prosperity of a county. Look at Canada as an example. They embraced immigration and have made efforts to streamline the process. Part of why so many here are undocumented is simply because our system of legal immigration is slow and cumbersome.,Harmless

I agree with your point about appropriation being an artifact of power dynamics and that it is not reversible; if the hegemony coopts a story from a subjugated people, the risk of appropriation is quite high.

"Prevedouros is right on how potholes need to be repaired.  The methods used by the
City are ineffective and last only until the next heavy rain.  Talk about whack a mole.
The other issue is how the City  paid contractors does its repaving. If you ever watch how its done, it is very quick however the layer of asphalt laid down is very thin,  unlike years ago when
it was not so mechanized.  Back in the 1960's the asphalt layer of road were at least
five inches thick if not more.  These roads lasted  and rarely developed
potholes and when potholes did occur, the fix always involved a heavy roller machine to
pack down and compress the material which made for long lasting repair. Not today,
tamping down the pothole fill with a shovel  is ineffective and it begins to loosen in no time.
 Having to constantly  repave the roads and to fix potholes is  a great way of  handing out the

It is also evident from Scripture that Christian Slave-owners were expected to treat their slaves as ‘brothers’ rather than chattels.

"Paul,  What is really in the social DNA of Oregon is a constant struggle to eliminate racism that is still going on today.  Way back in 1845 led by Jesse Applegate, Oregon revised its founding 1843 Organic Laws of Oregon (passed by about 100 white men) lessening the grip of discrimination/racism.  It started the process of repealing the Black Exclusion Laws in 1893 and finally accomplished it in 1927.  The KKK ( a broad national movement at the time) made an appearance in 1921 and disappeared in 1925 to never return.  Notice those two dates, 1925 and 1927?  Is Oregon free of racism, nope and it probably never will be.  But every year Oregonians try to eliminate it and make Oregon better for all of its citizens.  That positive trying to eliminate racism is as much a part of Oregon's story as the negative aspects of its racial past and present.",Harmless

Members of Congress have what amounts to Medicare. We should be working toward a system in which everyone has Medicare. That system is achievable, but it pits the 'rugged individualism' of conservative economics, which treats health care as a widget, available to those who can afford it, against the 'common good' approach of progressive economics, which treats health care as a human right and is committed to working toward the goal of making that a reality.

Muslims need to learn that hitting women is unacceptable, illegal, and immoral.

So they are happy to load you up to the hilt knowing they still get their money back if you default. 

However at least the current government last year started insisting the banks conduct a 'stress test' on any mortgage it wanted to take out CMHC insurance on. (Something that should have been done a number of years ago.)

"Sorry - your reply wasn't up when I wrote my response. Right now I think I can see your point. But I am still concerned about how much our health care ""system"" costs, regardless of who provides insurance. For example, would you retain Medicare in your proposal? One of the issues that Bush's drug benefit created was Congress's prohibition on price negotiations with big pharma - which seems to increase costs across the board for US consumers. And, of course, as I wrote above, the fact that doctors, hospitals, etc., charge fees for each service provided, which obviously incentivizes more, not less, care (and more care is not always good for one's health). Finally, what would you propose re. the whole pre-existing conditions issue? Auto insurance differs from homeowners in a crucial way. If one wants to drive, one needs to buy insurance (though one can choose the coverage amount) - not so for homeowners (except if one has a mortgage). Would you make people buy health insurance?",Harmless

When they realize that draining the swamp, building a wall, resurrecting the rust belt, and amassing a large trade surplus is easier said than done their attention will drift elsewhere.  And Trump himself, as hardheaded as he is, will likely come to realize that bullyboy tactics don't play exceedingly well with respect to diplomacy.

My impression is that comments can be ""disappeared"" through various mechanisms, none of them to do with ""a glitch"".

1. The laypersons who do the initial reviews trash them as badly uncivil posts, when they are not, and it does not see the light of day on the baord.
2. The laypersons let it get posted, but it gets flagged by others as offensive (when it is not, it simply grates on their sociopolitical preferences), and in some silly fashion gets deleted when it ought not get deleted.
3. I suspect the columnists and journalists themselves have access, should they want it, to fast-track intervention with those in charge of board moderation.

I am not suggesting it is a Globe and Mail editor who is behind what is happening.

"So Walker had the money in the Constitutional Budget Reserve to pay the tax credits this year.  But instead he vetoed the payment and now wants someone else to pay the bill.  And then he hopes to pay back that someone the amount owed ... PLUS INTEREST.  If at the end of the year this deal started, then the state would owe a principal of $700,000,000 plus interest.   If the interest rate was 5%, then the state would owe the bond holder an additional $35 million a year, every year.

The good thing about this is that is shows the ballpark cost of Walker being an idiot and vetoing the payment of tax credits.  His stupidity will may likely cost the state $35 million a year, for the length of the bond issue.  If the bond is 10 years, we're talking about a bad decision by Walker that costs Alaska around $350 million.  Walker is a very expensive fool.",Harmful

Democrat Al Francken may have defeated his Republican opponent in the 2008 Minnesota Senate race thanks to illegal voters. The Washington Post, using data from the Co-operative Congressional Election Study, estimated that 6.4% of non-citizens voted in 2008. Given the demonization of Trump during the election campaign it would seem likely that higher numbers of non-citizens might have voted illegally in 2016 to defeat Trump.

The Nathu La clashes started on 11 September 1967, when the People's Liberation Army (PLA) launched an attack on Indian posts at Nathu La, and lasted till 15 September 1967. In October 1967, another military duel took place at Cho La and ended on the same day.

The rest of us have and continue to bring America into the 21st century so that Americans can have the levels of public health and safety enjoyed by citizens of other advanced industrialized nations. 
No one would say Americans are politically astute people or that they learn quickly from history for they do not. But you would think there would be a point at which they would gather that electing Republicans is dangerous. The problem is that the Republican party knows this and so has sought extralegal means by which to win elections. Their party is a fraud and and curse. It's either Americans for an American quality of life or Republicans, fascism and the destruction of America. It's that simple. Republicans and the ugly and antidemocratic values they espouse must be repudiated. Otherwise, more Americans will be slaughtered in mass shootings.",Harmful

"There are no better examples of the failure of modern conservatism than US gun policy, the American healthcare system and the epic fail called the drug war. 

Even though no other developed country has the death by firearm rate of the US simply because they have fewer guns, conservatives always insist more guns is the answer. 

And even though every other developed country on earth has a better, more efficient healthcare system, the conservative doesn't care because that's socialism and they prefer freedom...or some such nonsense. 

And despite the epic failure & the money and lives wasted on the ""war on drugs"", conservatives won't stand for anything but outright prohibition. 
 
Despite irrefutable evidence of the failure, conservatives maintain a death grip on these policies because to do otherwise means acknowledging that the Left was and is right and the Right is and has been wrong all along.  And the conservative just cannot allow that.",Harmless
"By ""jobs,"" Trump voters meant ""jobs for white men"". They did not want family leave to help women, a path to citizenship for Hispanics, legal protection for LGBT, travel for Muslim workers, or help for Black Lives Matter.  It doesn't matter if Trump keeps his promises, or even if he actively contradicts himself: Trump voters know that whatever he does, Trump will put white men first. They elected him, not for any policy, but to protect them from having a woman, another black man, or a white person who sympathizes with the marginalized in the White House.",Harmful

"""The ex-spy has been forced into hiding, fearing for his safety as Mr. Trump and Russian officials angrily denounce his sleuthing.""

This is one of  those globe type assertions which belie their obvious anti trump , anti Russian agenda. It is is exactly this kind of reporting that explains why so many people don't believe the media and are walking away from the globe and mail.

 Is there any truth to this claim or is it merely a political agenda that he ""fears for his life""

"Let's review. 
Sometime around 2014 
""RCMP said close to 90 per cent of all female homicides are solved, and there is little difference in solve rates between aboriginal and non-aboriginal victims.
Overall, the RCMP review -- drawing on data stretching back to 1980 -- identified 1,181 police-recorded incidents of aboriginal female homicides and unresolved missing aboriginal females -- 164 missing and 1,017 homicide victims.""

Harper correctly concludes that the ""murdered and missing"" inquiry wasn't needed because there was no mystery to solve. 
Usual epithets are thrown his way: racist, divisive, mean-spirited etc etc 

""I want my Canada back"" Trudeau promises inquiry.
Hooray!
So far $50M spent mostly to line the pockets of the usual suspects in the Indian Industry. 
Meanwhile there really isn't any inquiry at all.

No inquiry vs No inquiry +$50M (and counting) wasted.

"From my experience in the military and my reading of the NY Times article about this incident, it sounds to me like some officers at USPACOM in Hawaii and the Pentagon are in some serious trouble.

""White House officials said Tuesday that they had been relying on guidance from the Defense Department. Officials there described a glitch-ridden sequence of events, from an ill-timed announcement of the deployment by the military’s Pacific Command to a partially erroneous explanation by the defense secretary, Jim Mattis — all of which perpetuated the false narrative that a flotilla was racing toward the waters off North Korea.""

Well Mr Cole, The problem is basing a state income tax off of a  Federal tax in which less than half of Americans pay into, and in Alaskas case, much less than half will pay into is patently unfair.

"“Canada’s commitment to challenge Russia”

Appease the US, prop up a brutal, corrupt, far-right puppet regime installed and controlled by Washington, and to participate in the larger campaign to undermine Russia (and China) as US/EU power wanes as a result of corruption, the economic collapse caused by neoliberal ""globalization"", unprecedented corporate power and inequality, and of course, the strain of the incessant US-led criminal wars of the past 15 years, the most recent being part of the campaign.

“The best way to diminish Russia’s influence in the region”

Is this really a worthy goal?

While I agree with your suggested alternative, and commend you for – unlike the bulk of our media - acknowledging the coup that set this all in motion, a stable, democratic Ukraine is the last thing  the American architects of this avoidable crisis want.

"Fair comment Doug. It is always a struggle to find good volunteers and coaches. 

My kids were fortunate they mostly had good coaches in hockey, soccer and flag football. Even if they weren't the most strategic and skilled, they were caring and fair. That was always my bottom line in recreational sport. 

But......there were a couple of times in hockey when things were not so pleasant. Yes, there was the time at an out-of-town tournament when the assistant coach, manager and trainer showed up stinking of alcohol from the night before. The stench was worse than the reek from wet hockey equipment. They also were playing their sons on double and even triple shifts. It all ended when the head coach released them and brought in some new parents to take over. Nasty stuff!",Harmless

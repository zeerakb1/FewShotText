In almost all of the post war elections Catholics were solidly Democratic and the issue of clerical sex abuse was not a public issue, even when it was much more serious in the 1960's and 1970's.  Catholics went Republican for Bush in the contentions election of 2000 and the \"Great Lent\" storm hit in Boston in 2002.   This went on for several years then began to die down after about 2008 with the Democrats getting a thin margin of Catholic voters.   But Trump had the  \"Holy Grail\" in the 2016 election earlier this month, so I suspect another storm is coming.

The writer uses the year 2010, which according to the chart, is more or less an average year for the range shown with a total income of nearly $228 million.\nHow does this compare with data you've seen? Would these donations, when compared to total income, constitute huge influence?"}

There is disagreement as to their function...\" Yes, but what the hell does that mean?\n\nThe question being asked in Rome by the Commission is whether those known differences in function mean the \"women deacons\" were \"deacons\" in the precise sense of having received the sacrament of Holy Orders, or were they \"deacons\" in some other sense. In RC terms, were those female deacons in major orders, like male deacons, or were they in minor orders. In Byzantine terms, did they receive Cheirotonia or Cheirothesia."}

Several Nuclear Submarines capable of long sustained patrols of our Northern waters.\n\nJust in the last year or so, China has built quite a few warships with ice cutting capabilities.   Not a lot of ice down in the South China sea or the Pacific."}
{"label": "Harmless", "sentence": "Probably just empty rhetoric. One wonders on what grounds drilling should be allowed without first assuring that the environment and public health are safeguarded. That's what the state is appealing to be allowed to do. How can they justify that?"}
{"label": "Harmful", "sentence": "Or maybe they did hear things on those topics, and concluded that an unmarried childless man  preaching about contraception is not to be taken seriously; a man who can never get pregnant should mind his own business about whether a woman should choose to bear a child; and sermons about Hell are not to be taken seriously."}

{"label": "Harmful", "sentence": "I see. There is only ONE definition of patriotism.  You know and understand it......I don't.  Have you considered that such a position is just a little presumptuous?  You may consider voting for Donald Trump was the \"patriotic\" thing to do.  I, on the other hand, considered that voting (in effect) against him was the patriotic thing to do.  We both voted to advance the welfare of America. The same is true for dozens of issues.  Defining someone who has views and opinions on political and social issues which differ from your doesn't, IMO, make those views unpatriotic.  You state \"if you really knew and understood American \"patriotism\" then you would also know \"your definition\" simply doesn't hold water\".  \n\nIn sum your position is quite simple:  You are the patriot and you know what patriotism \"is.\"  Anyone who might have a different view is, by definition, ignorant and wrong.  Such a sad, narrow, selfish view.................  Gary Crum"}
